Mit der Neukotierungen von vier Bitcoin- und Ethereum-ETP der US-Firma VanEck am Freitag werden nun insgesamt 100 Exchange Traded Products (ETP) und Strukturierte Produkte mit Kryptowährungen als Basiswert an der SIX gehandelt.

Mit dem breiten Angebot an Kryptoprodukten sei die SIX weltweit führend, schrieb die Börse in einer Medienmitteilung vom Freitag. Seit Jahresbeginn wurden an der SIX Produkte auf Basis von Kryptowährungen im Wert von fast 4,6 Milliarden Franken gehandelt – im Vergleich zum gesamten letzten Jahr ist das ein Plus von 310 Prozent.

Von den 100 Kryptoprodukten basieren deren 59 auf den beiden liquidesten Kryptowährungen Bitcoin und Ethereum. Das Angebot umfasse aber auch acht weitere Kryptowährungen. Beim grössten Teil davon wendeten sich die Anleger zunehmend besicherten ETPs zu, schrieb die SIX.

Die vier neuen ETP des US-Vermögensverwalters VanEck wollen Anlegern eine Beteiligung an der Kursentwicklung von Bitcoin und Ethereum bieten, ohne dass diese die Kryptowährungen selbst halten müssen. Die vier ETPs sind laut den Angaben mit der entsprechenden Kryptowährung zu 100 Prozent hinterlegt. VanEck ist seit 2015 an der Börse SIX aktiv.

SNB-Direktorin Maechler gegen breit verfügbares Digitalgeld

Die Schweizerische Nationalbank (SNB) will weiterhin kein breit verfügbares Zentralbanken-Digitalgeld. Es sei die weitaus bessere Alternative, wenn die Nationalbank innerhalb des bestehenden Zahlungssystems Sofortzahlungen ermögliche, sagte SNB-Direktoriumsmitglied Andréa Maechler an einem Bankenanlass.

Die Möglichkeit sofortiger Zahlungen werde heute von den Konsumenten erwartet, sagte Maechler in ihrem Referat am letzten Dienstag am «Branchentalk Banken» in Zürich. «Das hat sich während der Corona-Pandemie noch beschleunigt.» Tatsächlich dauert die Abwicklung einer Zahlung über SIC (Swiss Interbank Clearing) derzeit aber noch zwei Tage – «das gilt auch für Twint, auch wenn sie das nicht merken.»

Kein Konflikt mit Banken

Eine Möglichkeit wäre es, solche Sofortzahlungen über eine breit verfügbare Zentralbanken-Digitalwährung zu ermöglichen, wie Maechler einräumte. Die SNB halte es aber für die viel bessere Alternative, das bereits bestehende und auch krisenerprobte Zahlungssystem für Sofortzahlungen bereit zu machen. Die SNB wolle dies «in Sekunden» ermöglichen.

Gegen eine solche «Retail-CBDC» (Central Bank Digital Currency) spreche weiterhin vor allem, dass die Nationalbank nicht in die Domäne der Banken eindringen wolle. So könnte die Gefahr bestehen, dass die Menschen in Krisenzeiten ihre Gelder aus den Geschäftsbanken abziehen und ihr Geld in grossem Stil in die sicheren Retail-CBDC umschichten.

Weiterhin untersucht die SNB dagegen eine «Wholesale»-CBDC, die lediglich von Finanzinstituten benutzt werden kann. Wie bekannt hatte die Nationalbank gemeinsam im Rahmen des «Projekts Helvetia» zwei Varianten einer solchen Währung getestet, die den Finanzinstituten neue technische Möglichkeiten wie «Smart Contracts» ermöglicht. «Wir als Zentralbank müssen diese Technologie gut verstehen», sagte Maechler.

Bitcoin ist spekulative Anlage

Kryptowährungen wie Bitcoin oder Ether erkennt die SNB-Direktorin derweil nicht als eigentliches Geld an: Dafür erfüllten sie wesentliche Eigenschaften nicht. Nicht zuletzt die sehr hohen Wertschwankungen der Kryptowährungen sprächen dagegen. «Wir sehen Kryptowährungen als ein spekulatives Anlageinstrument.»

Dass die SNB selbst in Bitcoin investieren würde, käme für Maechler derzeit «nicht in Frage», wie sie auf eine entsprechende Frage sagte. Dies nicht nur deshalb, weil die Kryptowährung Probleme mit der Reputation habe. Für eine Investition der Nationalbank in eine Anlageklasse müsse auch eine hohe Liquidität am Markt vorhanden sein, sagte sie.

With the new features of four Bitcoin and Ethereum ETP of the US company Vaneck on Friday, a total of 100 Exchange Traded Products (ETP) and structured products with cryptocurrencies are traded as a basic value on the SIX.

With the wide range of crypto products, the SIX is a leader worldwide, the stock exchange wrote in a media release on Friday.Since the beginning of the year, the SIX products based on cryptocurrencies worth almost CHF 4.6 billion have been traded - compared to the entire last year, this is an increase of 310 percent.

Of the 100 crypto products, their 59 are based on the two most liquid cryptocurrencies Bitcoin and Ethereum.The offer also includes eight other cryptocurrencies.In the majority of this, investors increasingly turned to ETPs, the Six wrote.

The four new ETP of the US assets administrator Vaneck want to offer investors to participate in the course development of Bitcoin and Ethereum without having to keep the cryptocurrencies themselves.According to the information, the four ETPs are 100 percent stored with the corresponding cryptocurrency.Vaneck has been active on the SIX stock exchange since 2015.

SNB director Maechler against wide-available digital money

The Swiss National Bank (SNB) still does not want a wide range of central banking digit money.It is the far better alternative if the National Bank enables immediate payments within the existing payment system, said SNB directorate member Andréa Maechler at a banking event.

The possibility of immediate payments is expected today by consumers, Maechler said in her presentation on the last Tuesday at the ""Industry Talk Banken"" in Zurich.""That accelerated during the Corona pandemic.""In fact, the processing of a payment via SIC (Swiss Interbank Clearing) currently takes two days - ""This also applies to Twint, even if you don't notice that.""

No conflict with banks

One possibility would be to enable such immediate payments via a broadly available central banking digital currency, as Maechler granted.However, the SNB thinks it is the much better alternative to make the existing and crisis -proven payment system ready for immediate payment.The SNB wants to enable this ""in seconds"".

Against such a “Retail CBDC” (Central Bank Digital Currency), the main thing is that the National Bank does not want to penetrate the banks of the banks.So there could be a risk that people in times of crisis will deduct their funds from the commercial banks and to lay their money into the safe retail CBDC on a large scale.

The SNB, on the other hand, examines a “wholesale” CBDC that can only be used by financial institutions.As is known, the National Bank, together as part of the “Project Helvetia”, had tested two variants of such a currency, which enables the financial institutions to make new technical options such as “smart contracts”.""As a central bank, we as a central bank have to understand this technology well,"" said Maechler.

Bitcoin is speculative system

The SNB director does not recognize cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or ether as actual money: they did not meet essential properties for this.Last but not least, the very high fluctuations in value of the cryptocurrencies speak.""We see cryptocurrencies as a speculative investment tool.""

For Maechler, the fact that the SNB would invest in Bitcoin would currently be “out of the question”, as she said to a question.This is not only because the cryptocurrency has problems with the reputation.There must also be high liquidity on the market for an investment by the National Bank in an investment class, she said.

El directorio del ente rector del sistema financiero local dispuso explícitamente hoy que “no podrán realizar ni facilitar a sus clientes la realización de operaciones con activos digitales, incluidos los criptoactivos y aquellos cuyos rendimientos se determinen en función de las variaciones que esos registren, que no se encuentren regulados por autoridad nacional y autorizados por el Banco Central de la República Argentina (BCRA)”.

En un comunicado al respecto, explicó que con la prohibición procura “mitigar los riesgos asociados a las operaciones con estos activos que podrían generar para las personas usuarias de servicios financieros y para el sistema financiero en su conjunto”.

De allí que el BCRA haya optado ahora por una veda explícita al respecto. En el comunicado, la entidad recordó textualmente que “la actividad de las entidades financieras debe estar orientada a financiar la inversión, la producción, la comercialización, el consumo de los bienes y servicios requeridos tanto por la demanda interna como por la exportación”.

Y que ya en mayo de 2021, junto a la Comisión Nacional de Valores (CNV), había publicado un alerta sobre las “eventuales implicancias y riesgos que las operaciones con criptoactivos pueden acarrear” en el que recomendaba “una actitud prudente a fin de mitigar una eventual fuente de vulnerabilidad para las personas usuarias e inversores”.

La nota no alude a las escasas oportunidades que los argentinos que tengan la posibilidad de tener ahorros tienen para resguardar el valor de sus ingresos en un previsible contexto de inflación descontrolada.

Desde los bancos alcanzados por el cambio de norma aseguraron que están a la espera del detalle de la normativa para resolver. “Estamos esperando que salga la para analizarla. Lo que podemos asegurar es que ningún cliente que haya operado con criptoactivos en Banco Galicia perderá dinero”, aseguraron desde esa entidad ante una consulta al respecto.

Hence the BCRA has now opted for an explicit closure about it.In the statement, the entity textually recalled that ""the activity of financial institutions must be oriented to finance investment, production, commercialization, consumption of goods and services required both for internal demand and export.""

And that in May 2021, together with the National Securities Commission (CNV), he had published an alert on the “eventual implications and risks that cryptoactive operations can lead to” in which he recommended “a prudent attitude in order to mitigatean eventual source of vulnerability for users and investors. ”

The note does not refer to the few opportunities that Argentines who have the possibility of having savings have to protect the value of their income in a foreseeable context of uncontrolled inflation.

From the banks reached by the change of norm they assured that they are waiting for the detail of the regulations to resolve.“We are waiting for him to analyze it.What we can assure is that no client who has operated with cryptoactive in Banco Galicia will lose money, ”they said from that entity before a consultation in this regard.

Cryptocurrency transactions or trade should be deemed as crimes if they involve money laundering or terror financing, the central bank says

Owning cryptocurrencies or carrying out virtual transactions and trade through them is not a criminal offence, the Bangladesh Bank recently said in a letter to the Criminal Investigation Department (CID).

The Foreign Monetary Policy Division of the central bank wrote in the letter that cryptocurrency transactions or trade should be deemed as crimes if they involve money laundering or terror financing, a CID source has confirmed.

Even if the ownership, preservation, or transaction of cryptocurrency is not recognized, it does not appear to be a crime, reads the letter sent in May.

However, transactions in virtual currencies can be listed as crimes under the second phase of the Foreign Exchange Control Act 1947, Anti-Terrorism Act 2009, and the Prevention of Money Laundering Act 2012, the letter adds.

Speaking to Dhaka Tribune about the matter, Syed Almas Kabir, president of the Bangladesh Association of Software and Information Services (BASIS), said: “Cryptocurrency is the future. When we want to move towards a cashless society, we cannot be in denial. We have to start preparing to adapt to the implementation of such technology that has the potential to develop several industries.”

He also said skilled human resources need to be developed for reaping the benefits of blockchain technology, as well as a local evaluation of the currency against the Taka.

There is also a big opportunity for Bangladeshi fintech and software industries if the stance of the legality of cryptocurrencies is made clear and policies are implemented, said a top official of a non-bank financial institution (NBFIs) that has been developing such blockchain-based technology for its clients.

Although several financial institutions such as NBFIs have been actively trying to develop blockchain-based services, the local acceptance of cryptocurrency has been almost non-existent so far.

Bangladesh is one of the few countries in the world that consider bitcoin and all other types of cryptocurrencies as ""hostile"".

COMUNICADO Nº 25.306, DE 19 DE FEVEREIRO DE 2014 Esclarece sobre os riscos decorrentes da aquisição das chamadas ""moedas virtuais"" ou ""moedas criptografadas"" e da realização de transações com elas. O Banco Central do Brasil esclarece, inicialmente, que as chamadas moedas virtuais não se confundem com a “moeda eletrônica” de que tratam a Lei nº 12.865, de 9 de outubro de 2013, e sua regulamentação infralegal. Moedas eletrônicas, conforme disciplinadas por esses atos normativos, são recursos armazenados em dispositivo ou sistema eletrônico que permitem ao usuário final efetuar transação de pagamento denominada em moeda nacional. Por sua vez, as chamadas moedas virtuais possuem forma própria de denominação, ou seja, são denominadas em unidade de conta distinta das moedas emitidas por governos soberanos, e não se caracterizam dispositivo ou sistema eletrônico para armazenamento em reais. 2. A utilização das chamadas moedas virtuais e a incidência, sobre elas, de normas aplicáveis aos sistemas financeiro e de pagamentos têm sido temas de debate internacional e de manifestações de autoridades monetárias e de outras autoridades públicas, com poucas conclusões até o momento. 3. As chamadas moedas virtuais não são emitidas nem garantidas por uma autoridade monetária. Algumas são emitidas e intermediadas por entidades não financeiras e outras não têm sequer uma entidade responsável por sua emissão. Em ambos os casos, as entidades e pessoas que emitem ou fazem a intermediação desses ativos virtuais não são reguladas nem supervisionadas por autoridades monetárias de qualquer país. 4. Essas chamadas moedas virtuais não têm garantia de conversão para a moeda oficial, tampouco são garantidos por ativo real de qualquer espécie. O valor de conversão de um ativo conhecido como moeda virtual para moedas emitidas por autoridades monetárias depende da credibilidade e da confiança que os agentes de mercado possuam na aceitação da chamada moeda virtual como meio de troca e das expectativas de sua valorização. Não há, portanto, nenhum mecanismo governamental que garanta o valor em moeda oficial dos instrumentos conhecidos como moedas virtuais, ficando todo o risco de sua aceitação nas mãos dos usuários. 5. Em função do baixo volume de transações, de sua baixa aceitação como meio de troca e da falta de percepção clara sobre sua fidedignidade, a variação dos preços das chamadas moedas virtuais pode ser muito grande e rápida, podendo até mesmo levar à perda total de seu valor. 6. Na mesma linha, a eventual aplicação, por autoridades monetárias de quaisquer países, de medidas prudenciais, coercitivas ou punitivas sobre o uso desses ativos, pode afetar significativamente o preço de tais moedas ou mesmo a capacidade de sua negociação. 7. Além disso, esses instrumentos virtuais podem ser utilizados em atividades ilícitas, o que pode dar ensejo a investigações conduzidas pelas autoridades públicas. Dessa forma, o usuário desses ativos virtuais, ainda que realize transações de boa-fé, pode se ver envolvido nas referidas investigações. 8. Por fim, o armazenamento das chamadas moedas virtuais nas denominadas carteiras eletrônicas apresenta o risco de que o detentor desses ativos sofra perdas patrimoniais decorrentes de ataques de criminosos que atuam no espaço da rede mundial de computadores. 9. No Brasil, embora o uso das chamadas moedas virtuais ainda não se tenha mostrado capaz de oferecer riscos ao Sistema Financeiro Nacional, particularmente às transações de pagamentos de varejo (art. 6º, § 4º, da Lei nº 12.685/2013), o Banco Central do Brasil está acompanhando a evolução da utilização de tais instrumentos e as discussões nos foros internacionais sobre a matéria – em especial sobre sua natureza, propriedade e funcionamento –, para fins de adoção de eventuais medidas no âmbito de sua competência legal, se for o caso.

Notice No. 25,306 of February 19, 2014 clarifies the risks arising from the acquisition of so -called ""virtual currencies"" or ""encrypted currencies"" and transactions with them.The Central Bank of Brazil clarifies, initially, that so -called virtual currencies are not confused with the “electronic currency” dealt with in Law No. 12,865, of October 9, 2013, and their infralegal regulation.Electronic currencies, as disciplined by these normative acts, are features stored on an electronic device or system that allows the end user to make payment transaction called in national currency.In turn, the so -called virtual currencies have their own form of denomination, that is, they are called a unit of account distinct from the coins issued by sovereign governments, and are not characterized by the electronic device or system for storage in reais.2. The use of so -called virtual currencies and the incidence, on them, rules applicable to financial and payment systems have been issues of international debate and demonstrations of monetary authorities and other public authorities, with few conclusions so far.3. The so -called virtual coins are not issued or guaranteed by a monetary authority.Some are issued and brokered by non -financial entities and others do not even have an entity responsible for their issuance.In both cases, entities and people who issue or intermediate these virtual assets are not regulated or supervised by monetary authorities in any country.4. These so -called virtual currencies have no guarantee of conversion to the official currency, nor are they guaranteed by actual assets of any kind.The conversion value of an asset known as virtual currency to currencies issued by monetary authorities depends on the credibility and confidence that market agents have the acceptance of the so -called virtual currency as a means of exchange and the expectations of its appreciation.There is therefore no government mechanism that guarantees the official currency value of the instruments known as virtual currencies, the risk of their acceptance in the hands of users.5. Depending on the low volume of transactions, its low acceptance as a means of exchange and the lack of clear perception of its reliability, the variation in the prices of so -called virtual currencies can be very large and rapid, and may even lead to total lossof its value.6. In the same line, the eventual application by monetary authorities of any countries of prudential, coercive or punitive measures on the use of these assets may significantly affect the price of such currencies or even the ability to negotiate.7. In addition, these virtual instruments may be used in illicit activities, which may give rise to investigations conducted by public authorities.Thus, the user of these virtual assets, even though they perform good faith transactions, can be involved in these investigations.8. Finally, the storage of so -called virtual currencies in so -called electronic wallets presents the risk that the holder of these assets suffer from heritage losses from attacks by criminals operating in the space of the worldwide computer network.9. In Brazil, although the use of so -called virtual currencies has not yet been shown to pose risks to the national financial system, particularly to retail payment transactions (art. 6, § 4, of Law No. 12.685/2013), theCentral Bank of Brazil is following the evolution of the use of such instruments and discussions in international forums on the matter - especially on their nature, property and operation - for the purpose of adopting any measures within their legal competence, if it isthe case.

Just days ago, BMO Financial Group (the Bank of Montreal) announced that it would ban its credit and debit card customers from participating in cryptocurrency purchases with their cards. This makes Bank of Montreal the latest Canadian financial institution to make a move against the digital currency trend, according to decentralpost.com. Canadian investors looking to buy cryptocurrencies are increasingly forced to look to a limited range of options to facilitate their purchases.

Major Canadian Banks Ban Transactions

Bank of Montreal is only the most recent major Canadian bank to issue a ban for its customers. Last month, Toronto Dominion (TD Bank) blocked its customers from buying digital currencies. Recently, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the country's second-largest bank by assets, determined that it would allow cryptocurrency transactions only ""in limited circumstances,"" although it did not ban digital currency purchases for its users outright.

Canadian Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts Find Other Means

Even while major banks have issued bans on digital currency transactions, Canadian cryptocurrency investors have looked to other means. Over the past three weeks, P2P platform LocalBitcoins has seen trade activity increase six-fold, from $1.2 million in trades to $7.2 million as compared with the three-week period just prior.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies argue that the bank ban may in fact have a positive impact. After all, digital currencies like bitcoin are predicated on personal investor freedom.

Just days ago, BMO Financial Group (the Bank of Montreal) announced that it would ban its credit and debit card customers from participating in cryptocurrency purchases with their cards. This makes Bank of Montreal the latest Canadian financial institution to make a move against the digital currency trend, according to decentralpost.com. Canadian investors looking to buy cryptocurrencies are increasingly forced to look to a limited range of options to facilitate their purchases.

Major Canadian Banks Ban Transactions

Bank of Montreal is only the most recent major Canadian bank to issue a ban for its customers. Last month, Toronto Dominion (TD Bank) blocked its customers from buying digital currencies. Recently, Royal Bank of Canada (RBC), the country's second-largest bank by assets, determined that it would allow cryptocurrency transactions only ""in limited circumstances,"" although it did not ban digital currency purchases for its users outright.

Canadian Cryptocurrency Enthusiasts Find Other Means

Even while major banks have issued bans on digital currency transactions, Canadian cryptocurrency investors have looked to other means. Over the past three weeks, P2P platform LocalBitcoins has seen trade activity increase six-fold, from $1.2 million in trades to $7.2 million as compared with the three-week period just prior.

Supporters of cryptocurrencies argue that the bank ban may in fact have a positive impact. After all, digital currencies like bitcoin are predicated on personal investor freedom. If investors have to look outside of banking institutions in order to conduct these transactions, the thinking goes, they are benefiting by removing themselves from the traditional financial system, if only in part.

Summary Companies China intensifies crypto crackdown

Vows to root out ""illegal"" trading activity, bans mining

Bitcoin, smaller coins slump















SHANGHAI/LONDON, Sept 24 (Reuters) - China's most powerful regulators on Friday intensified a crackdown on cryptocurrencies with a blanket ban on all crypto transactions and mining, hitting bitcoin and other major coins and pressuring crypto and blockchain-related stocks.

Ten agencies, including the central bank, financial, securities and foreign exchange regulators, vowed to work together to root out ""illegal"" cryptocurrency activity, the first time the Beijing-based regulators have joined forces to explicitly ban all cryptocurrency-related activity.

Explainer: What's new in China's crackdown on crypto?

China in May banned financial institutions and payment companies from providing services related to cryptocurrency transactions, and issued similar bans in 2013 and 2017.

The repeated prohibitions highlight the challenge of closing loopholes and identifying bitcoin-related transactions, though banks and payment firms say they support the effort.

Friday's statement is the most detailed and expansive yet from the country's main regulators, underscoring Beijing's commitment to suffocating the Chinese crypto market.

""In the history of crypto market regulation in China, this is the most direct, most comprehensive regulatory framework involving the largest number of ministries,"" said Winston Ma, NYU Law School adjunct professor.

The move comes amid a global cryptocurrency crackdown as governments from Asia to the United States fret that privately operated highly volatile digital currencies could undermine their control of the financial and monetary systems, increase systemic risk, promote financial crime and hurt investors.

They also worry that ""mining,"" the energy-intensive computing process through which bitcoin and other tokens are created, is hurting global environmental goals.

Chinese government agencies have repeatedly raised concerns that cryptocurrency speculation could disrupt the country's economic and financial order, one of Beijing's top priorities.

Analysts say China also sees cryptocurrencies as a threat to its sovereign digital-yuan, which is at an advanced pilot stage.

""Beijing is so hostile to economic freedom they cannot even tolerate their people participating in what is arguably the most exciting innovation in finance in decades,"" top U.S. Republican Senator Pat Toomey tweeted.

While U.S. regulators are closely scrutinizing digital asset risks, they have said they also offer opportunities, including to promote financial inclusion.

'SOCIAL ORDER'

The People's Bank of China (PBOC) said cryptocurrencies must not circulate and that overseas exchanges are barred from providing services to China-based investors. It also barred financial institutions, payment companies and internet firms from facilitating cryptocurrency trading nationally.

The government will ""resolutely clamp down on virtual currency speculation ... to safeguard people's properties and maintain economic, financial and social order"", the PBOC said.

China's National Development and Reform Commission said it will work to cut off financial support and electricity supply for mining, which it said spawns risks and hampers carbon neutrality goals.

Bitcoin , the world's largest cryptocurrency, dropped more than 9% before paring those losses. It was down 6.6% at $41,937 around 12:00ET. Smaller coins, which typically mimic bitcoin, also tumbled.

China's cabinet vowed in May to crack down on bitcoin mining and trading as it sought to mitigate financial risks, without going into details, sending bitcoin tumbling 30% in a day. Friday's news dashed hopes among crypto-enthusiasts that the cabinet would fail to follow through on its threat.

""This is the manifestation of the crypto mining and trading crackdown announcement ... back in May,"" said NYU's Ma.

BOUNCE BACK?

The move also hit cryptocurrency and blockchain-related shares, although they clawed back some of those declines in morning U.S. trading.

U.S.-listed miners Riot Blockchain (RIOT.O), Marathon Digital (MARA.O) and Bit Digital (BTBT.O) slipped between 2.5% and 5%, while San Francisco crypto exchange Coinbase Global (COIN.O) fell just over 1%.

Despite the initial shock, analysts said they did not expect the crackdown to dent global crypto-asset prices long term as companies continue to adopt crypto products and services.

The exposure of major crypto exchanges and payment companies was not immediately clear, however. Binance, the world's biggest, has been blocked in China since 2017, a spokesperson said. A spokesperson for Coinbase declined to comment. Global payment company PayPal(PYPL.O) does not offer crypto services in China, a spokesperson said.

Crypto exchanges OKEx and Huobi, which originated in China but are now based overseas, are likely to be the worst affected since they still have some China users, analysts said. Tokens associated with the two exchanges plunged over 20%. The exchanges did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

However, the Chinese government has struggled in the past to stop internet users from evading its controls.

""China's actions haven't held back crypto's rise too much in the past so I wouldn't be surprised to see it bounce back once more,"" wrote Craig Erlam, an analyst at currency broker OANDA.

Virtual currency mining had been big business in China before May, accounting for more than half the world's crypto supply, but miners have been moving overseas.

""The losers in all of this are plainly the Chinese,"" said Christopher Bendiksen, head of research at digital asset manager CoinShares. ""They will now lose around $6 billion worth of annual mining revenue, all of which will flow to the remaining global mining regions,"" he added, citing Kazakhstan, Russia and the United States.

Local governments told to ask mining firms to 'orderly exit' business

The nation's top financial regulator has suggested that local governments encourage bitcoin miners to gradually reduce production of the cryptocurrency until finally quitting the business, a signal of an upgraded campaign to crack down on financial risks arising in the fast-developing fintech sector.

A senior official with the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, who declined to be named, told China Daily on Thursday that a notice had been sent recently to local governments, asking bitcoin mining companies to ""orderly exit"" the business.

The notice is issued by the Office of the Special Rectification Work Leadership Team for Internet Financial Risks, which was set up by the State Council in April 2016 with a leader from the central bank. The special team also regulates the country's cryptocurrency business.

Some bitcoin miners told China Daily that they had received notices from local governments to limit electricity consumption, and some of them had already moved part of the mining business overseas, to some locations with relatively cheaper costs for land rental and electricity, such as Mongolia.

Fu Liyong, deputy head of the local financial regulatory office in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, said that the regulatory move may also need to be coordinated with local government departments managing industrial and information technology, as the measures would start by controlling bitcoin producers' electricity consumption.

The move is an indication that the monetary authority will further tighten regulation on bitcoin, after it closed all bitcoin trading platforms in the country last year, amid concerns that the cryptocurrency may boost harmful speculation.

Bitcoin prices have been on a roller coaster recently. The price slumped from $14,951 on Dec 29 to $12,307 the following day, and it climbed back to $14,762 on Jan 4, according to Coindesk, a cryptocurrency news outlet.

""Price bubble exists for bitcoin, which needs no more discussion,"" said an editorial in People's Daily on Wednesday, calling it a ""reappearance"" of the Dutch ""Tulip Bubble"" of the 1630s.

The article called the hyped advantages of bitcoin－scarcity, high-liquidity, transparency and decentralization, ""disguises"" for speculation.

After closing cryptocurrency trading platforms, the top financial regulator will send licenses to fintech companies who are ""qualified"" to provide fintech business after investigation, according to some local financial officials.

""I think it will be an absolutely correct decision if the Chinese government indeed curbs bitcoin output with government regulation. It can efficiently eliminate the bubble in the blockchain-related financial market and provide a cleaner industry environment,"" said Sam Lee, CEO of Blockchain Global Ltd, an Australia-headquartered blockchain technology commercialization and investment company.

Local governments told to ask mining firms to 'orderly exit' business

The nation's top financial regulator has suggested that local governments encourage bitcoin miners to gradually reduce production of the cryptocurrency until finally quitting the business, a signal of an upgraded campaign to crack down on financial risks arising in the fast-developing fintech sector.

A senior official with the People's Bank of China, the nation's central bank, who declined to be named, told China Daily on Thursday that a notice had been sent recently to local governments, asking bitcoin mining companies to ""orderly exit"" the business.

The notice is issued by the Office of the Special Rectification Work Leadership Team for Internet Financial Risks, which was set up by the State Council in April 2016 with a leader from the central bank. The special team also regulates the country's cryptocurrency business.

Some bitcoin miners told China Daily that they had received notices from local governments to limit electricity consumption, and some of them had already moved part of the mining business overseas, to some locations with relatively cheaper costs for land rental and electricity, such as Mongolia.

Fu Liyong, deputy head of the local financial regulatory office in Ningbo, Zhejiang province, said that the regulatory move may also need to be coordinated with local government departments managing industrial and information technology, as the measures would start by controlling bitcoin producers' electricity consumption.

The move is an indication that the monetary authority will further tighten regulation on bitcoin, after it closed all bitcoin trading platforms in the country last year, amid concerns that the cryptocurrency may boost harmful speculation.

Bitcoin prices have been on a roller coaster recently. The price slumped from $14,951 on Dec 29 to $12,307 the following day, and it climbed back to $14,762 on Jan 4, according to Coindesk, a cryptocurrency news outlet.

""Price bubble exists for bitcoin, which needs no more discussion,"" said an editorial in People's Daily on Wednesday, calling it a ""reappearance"" of the Dutch ""Tulip Bubble"" of the 1630s.

The article called the hyped advantages of bitcoin－scarcity, high-liquidity, transparency and decentralization, ""disguises"" for speculation.

After closing cryptocurrency trading platforms, the top financial regulator will send licenses to fintech companies who are ""qualified"" to provide fintech business after investigation, according to some local financial officials.

""I think it will be an absolutely correct decision if the Chinese government indeed curbs bitcoin output with government regulation. It can efficiently eliminate the bubble in the blockchain-related financial market and provide a cleaner industry environment,"" said Sam Lee, CEO of Blockchain Global Ltd, an Australia-headquartered blockchain technology commercialization and investment company.

In the mean time, it reflects the Chinese government's determination to curb speculative behavior in the industry, added Lee, whose company is also running the blockchain-related consultancy company Blockshine in China.

According to a leaked January 2 memo from the ‘Leading Group of Internet Financial Risks Remediation’ — the country’s internet finance regulator which initiated the clampdown on bitcoin — bitcoin miners should make an “orderly exit” from China because they have consumed “huge amounts of resources and stoked speculation of ‘virtual currencies.”

Details of the memo were posted on Twitter by Chinese blockchain industry executive Elly Zhang and confirmed by Quartz.

The group itself doesn’t control national energy usage but it is an influential political vehicle that’s led by the deputy governor of the People’s Bank of China (PBC), Pan Gongsheng. To remove miners, the group asked its local offices to look into policies around price, tax, land usage and environmental concerns.

Its local representatives must report back on their progress of removing miners in their region on a monthly basis, according to Quartz.

The situation is complicated by the fact that many miners, and particularly those in China, make use of cheap power, or flock to locations where there’s excess capacity. In some cases, mining businesses partner with local governments to ensure a steady supply of electricity at discounted rates, with a portion of the profits returned to the local authorities. That’s offered a welcome economic boost in regions where more traditional industries are struggling.

But there’s no smoke without fire. It certainly seems like central government has a plan to stamp out the miners. Beyond today’s news, both Bloomberg and Reuters last week reported on the PBC’s plans to slowly cut down on the number of miners. That, apparently, includes dissolving any such agreements and deals that had previously been struck.

Perhaps wary of additional regulation, China’s bitcoin mining giants have already branched out to open new facilities in countries like Iceland, Canada and the U.S. Nonetheless, a serious move to crush the mining industry has the potential to impact bitcoin.

Přestože bitcoin ve virtuálním prostoru nekoluje zas tak dlouho, má dost pestrou historii. Jeho obliba časem zesílila natolik, že už ho státy nemohou ignorovat jako módní výstřelek geeků s jepičí životností. Přesto si s ním příliš neví rady. Jak se na bitcoiny dívají právníci a centrální banka?

Ani měna, ani investice

Česká národní banka (ČNB) bitcoiny dosud za alternativní měnu neprohlásila. Podle dokumentu na jejím webu pro obchodování s bitcoiny nebo jejich směnu není potřeba povolení ČNB.

Data evidovaná v protokolu bitcoin nemají charakter pohledávky držitele bitcoinů za jinou osobou, nejsou tedy bezhotovostní peněžní prostředky ani elektronické peníze (§ 4 zákona o platebních službách – ZPS), resp. peněžní prostředky ve smyslu ustanovení § 2 odst.1 písm. c) ZPS, vysvětluje ČNB s tím, že nákup či prodej bitcoinů na vlastní účet není žádnou z platebních služeb (dle § 3 odst. 1 ZPS) ani bezhotovostní obchod s cizí měnou (§ 2 odst. 1 písm. e) ZPS). Stejně tak podle centrální banky nepředstavuje platební službu ve smyslu provedení transakce (např. zaslání bitcoinů jinému uživateli) ani vedení účtu v bitcoinech (kdy bitcoiny za vlastníka spravuje, typicky v rámci „virtuální peněženky“ na internetové stránce, jiná osoba). Směnou bitcoinů nejsou naplněny ani znaky směnárenského obchodu (§ 2 odst. 1 ZSČ) a kryptoměna nevykazuje podle odkazovaného dokumentu ani znak investičního nástroje (s výjimkou obchodování s deriváty na bitcoiny).

Bitcoin je nehmotná věc

Oficiálně tedy bitcoin není měna. Obchodování s bitcoiny v jejich základní podobě nepodléhá povolení, regulaci a ani dohledu centrální banky. Pokud se tedy takového obchodu účastníte, nemáte žádnou ochranu či garanci ze strany právních předpisů a státu. Všechna rizika nesete sami.

Podrobnější zákonná úprava tzv. virtuálních měn tedy chybí. Jak ale upozornila Karin Pomaizlová, právní expertka advokátní kanceláře Taylor Wessing, definici bitcoinu jako virtuální měny zavedl zákon č. 253/2008 Sb., o některých opatřeních proti legalizaci výnosů z trestné činnosti a financování terorismu, v platném znění ve svém ust. § 2 odst. 1 písm. l): Virtuální měnou je elektronicky uchovávaná jednotka bez ohledu na to, zda má nebo nemá emitenta, a která není peněžním prostředkem podle zákona o platebním styku, ale je přijímána jako platba za zboží nebo služby i jinou osobou odlišnou od jejího emitenta.

Z náležitostí a způsobu fungování bitcoinu Pomaizlová vyvozuje, že se jedná o věc v právním smyslu, jak ji specifikuje ust. § 489 a násl. občanského zákoníku: Jedná se o věc nehmotnou ve smyslu ust. § 496 odst. 2 téhož zákona, kterou mohou být vedle práv též různá plnění, upřesnila Pomaizlová.

Jen pro ty s chladnou hlavou

Kontinuální existence bitcoinů a stabilita bitcoinového platebního systému je podle Pomaizlové odvozena a závislá na víře zúčastněných osob v tento systém a jeho fungování podobně, jako tomu je při obchodech se zlatem či diamanty. Bitcoiny jsou věcí univerzálně směnitelnou, fungující na jedné straně na základě důvěry nakupujících osob v to, že je budou moci směnit za pro ně užitečné věci či práva, a na druhé straně na základě důvěry platbu akceptujících osob, že přijaté bitcoiny v systému dále uplatní, uvedla. Ztráta důvěry v bitcoiny, kterou mohou vyvolat například hackerské útoky, tak může znamenat ztrátu hodnoty této kryptoměny a tím i finanční ztráty pro jejího držitele. Příkladem budiž pád tokijské bitcoinové burzy Mt. Gox, která byla v dané době největší na světě a na začátku roku 2014 na sebe musela po útoku hackerů a krádeži cca 650 milionů dolarů podat návrh na bankrot.

Přestože se jedná o neregulovanou neoficiální záležitost, podle Pomaizlové je nutné v případě krádeže uvažovat o bitcoinu jako o věci.

Považujeme-li bitcoin za věc, byť nehmotnou, je za její zcizení v případě prokázání viny pachatel odpovědný podle ust. § 205 zákona č. 40/2009 Sb. trestního zákoníku, které upravuje trestný čin krádeže. Trestná je i příprava takového protiprávního jednání. Trestní sazba může dosáhnout až 10 let, upozornila Pomaizlová z Taylor Wessing a dodala, že v úvahu připadá také kvalifikace konkrétního protiprávního jednání jako trestného činu podvodu (ust. § 209). V případě trestné činnosti, realizované v kybernetickém prostoru, však vyvstává otázka místní příslušnosti policejních orgánů a soudů a případně také aplikace práva konkrétního státu, naráží na případné potíže s domáháním se vlastnických práv.

Bitcoiny a EET

S tím, jak se bitcoiny (a další virtuální měny) budou šířit dál do společnosti, poroste potřeba je oficiálně nějak uchopit. Příkladem z poslední doby je Bitcoin Coffee provozované při spolku s názvem Paralelní Polis a problematika elektronické evidence tržeb (EET). Ve zmíněné kavárně za občerstvení totiž zaplatíte výhradně bitcoiny, které si ve zdejším automatu můžete směnit za vaše koruny.

Zástupci Paralelní Polis EET od počátku otevřeně bojkotují s odvoláním na manifest jednoho ze zakladatelů Charty 77 Václava Bendy a jeho apelu na potřebu paralelní ekonomiky ve svobodné společnosti: Systém EET pokládáme za reálný nástroj centralizované kontroly občanů ze strany státu. Centrálně ukládané informace o každém uskutečněném obchodu mohou být v budoucnu plošně zneužívány a souhrnná data o zákaznických preferencích představují drastický zásah do soukromí všech občanů, uvádí mluvčí Martin Šíp na webu Paralelní Polis a vyzývá všechny občany ČR, aby dělali to samé.





Od počátku vyhlášení bojkotu bylo jasné, že je jen otázkou času, kdy si sem přijde dát kafe také zástupce finančního úřadu. Za chybějící systém EET totiž hrozí pokuta, a pokud by provozovatel porušoval zákon nařizující evidovat tržby opakovaně, může dojít i k uzavření provozovny.

To však pro zástupce Paralalní Polis není směrodatné. Svým principům jsou ochotni obětovat i provoz kavárny: Otevřený střet je pro nás mj. příležitostí, jak dostat do veřejné diskuze témata, která jsou zásadní pro Paralelní Polis. Důležité je si uvědomit, že naše experimentální bitcoinová kavárna je jen jedním z několika konceptů Paralelní Polis a nestojí sama o sobě. Jejím cílem není generovat vnější zisk. Proto máme v tomto směru mnohem více volné ruce než ostatní kavárny a restaurace, které nemají příliš na výběr, vysvětlil serveru Měšec.cz Šíp s tím, že další postup závisí na oficiální reakci státu.

Formální náležitosti vs. nepodnikatelská činnost

Ten nyní zjevně situaci analyzuje, ačkoli podle mluvčí Generálního finančního ředitelství Petry Petlachové platba uskutečněná bitcoiny formální náležitosti pro evidovanou tržbu ve smyslu zákona o evidenci tržeb splňuje. Jedná se o formu obdobnou hotovosti. Za předpokladu, že by takováto platba zakládala rozhodný příjem podle zákona o evidenci tržeb, pak by se jednalo o evidovanou tržbu poplatníka, upřesnila serveru Petlachová.

V Metodickém pokynu k aplikaci zákona o evidenci tržeb se však přiznává dle konkrétní situace možnost výjimky pro kluby provozující hostinskou a související činnost, aniž by vystupovaly jako standardní restaurační zařízení. Roli zde hraje fakt, že daný klub, který může mít i charakter spolku, je provozován jako nepodnikatelský. Naopak příjmy z podnikatelské činnosti vykonávané tímto způsobem EET podléhají. Bitcoin Coffee by se do nepodnikatelské škatulky vejít mohla.

Den europæiske banktilsynsmyndighed EBA har udsendt en advarsel til forbrugere mod virtuelle valutaer, herunder bitcoin. Finanstilsynet bakker op om advarslen.

EBA gør i sin advarsel forbrugerne opmærksomme på, at der er række risici forbundet med at købe, sælge og eje virtuelle valutaer:

Du risikerer at miste din virtuelle valuta på en handelsplads.

Du risikerer, at virtuel valuta bliver stjålet fra din elektroniske tegnebog.

Du har ingen sikkerhed for, at du også fremover kan bruge virtuel valuta som betalingsmiddel, eller at du kan veksle tilbage til reel valuta.

Værdien af dine virtuelle valutaer kan ændre sig meget hurtigt og kan i princippet falde til nul.

Virtuelle valutaer kan blive misbrugt til kriminalitet.

Køb og salg af virtuelle valutaer kan have skatte- og afgiftsmæssige konsekvenser.

Bitcoin har i den senere tid været genstand for betydelig medieopmærksomhed. Der foreligger ikke offentlige data om udbredelsen eller omfanget af handelen med Bitcoin og andre virtuelle valutaer i Danmark.

Finanstilsynet har vurderet, at virtuel valuta ikke er omfattet af den gældende finansielle regulering i Danmark. Finanstilsynet har således i et konkret tilfælde godkendt, at et selskab ikke skal have tilladelse for at kunne etablere sig her i landet med henblik på at drive virksomhed med veksling af reel valuta mod såkaldt virtuel valuta, herunder bl.a. bitcoin, og vice versa.

Som baggrund for afgørelsen har Finanstilsynet vurderet, at aktiviteten hverken kunne betragtes som udstedelse af elektroniske penge, udbud af betalingstjenester, valutaveksling, modtagelse af indlån eller fondsmæglervirksomhed, og at aktiviteten derfor ikke er omfattet af den finansielle regulering.

Baggrundsinformation om virtuelle valutaer

Virtuelle valutaer er en form for uregulerede elektroniske penge, som i modsætning til reelle penge ikke er udstedt og garanteret af en centralbank, og som i visse tilfælde kan anvendes som betalingsmiddel.

Virtuelle valutaer er opstået i mange forskellige former, først i forbindelse med on-line spillevirksomhed og i sociale netværk. Senere har virtuelle valutaer udviklet sig til at blive anvendt som alternativ til reel valuta.

Bitcoin er den mest udbredte virtuelle valuta, men også LiteCoin, ZeroCoin og Linden Dollars kan nævnes bl.a. de mere kendte.

Bitcoin veksles i dag med reel valuta og accepteres som betalingsmiddel i stadigt stigende omfang, både on-line og off-line i den almindelige økonomi ved køb af varer og tjenesteydelser.

EBA warning on virtual currencies-embargoed.pdf (379KB)

Press release - EBA warning on virtual currencies-embargoed.pdf (343KB)","WARNING

The European Banking Authority EBA has issued a warning to consumers against virtual currencies, including Bitcoin.The Financial Supervisory Authority supports the warning.

In its warning, EBA makes consumers aware that there are a number of risks associated with buying, selling and owning virtual currencies:

You risk losing your virtual currency in a trading space.

You risk virtual currency being stolen from your electronic wallet.

You have no assurance that you can also use virtual currency as a means of payment in the future or that you can switch back to real currency.

The value of your virtual currencies can change very quickly and can in principle fall to zero.

Virtual currencies can be abused for crime.

The purchase and sale of virtual currencies can have tax and tax consequences.

Bitcoin has recently been the subject of significant media attention.There is no public data on the spread or extent of trade in Bitcoin and other virtual currencies in Denmark.

The Danish FSA has assessed that virtual currency is not covered by the current financial regulation in Denmark.Thus, in a specific case, the Danish Financial Supervisory Authority has approved that a company must not be allowed to establish itself in this country with a view to operating the exchange of real currency against so -called virtual currency, including among other things.Bitcoin, and vice versa.

As a background for the decision, the Danish FSA has considered that the activity could not be considered as the issue of electronic money, the offer of payment services, currency exchange, receipt of deposits or fund brokerage, and that the activity is therefore not covered by the financial regulation.

Background information about virtual currencies

Virtual currencies are a form of unregulated electronic money which, unlike real money, has not been issued and guaranteed by a central bank and which in some cases can be used as a means of payment.

Virtual currencies have emerged in many different forms, first in connection with on-line gaming and in social networks.Later, virtual currencies have evolved to be used as an alternative to real currency.

Bitcoin is the most widespread virtual currency, but also litecoin, zerocoin and linden dollars can be mentioned, among other things.The more known.

Today, Bitcoin is exchanged with real currency and is accepted as a means of payment to an ever-increasing extent, both on-line and off-line in the ordinary economy when purchasing goods and services.

Ukraine announced limits on bitcoin purchases Friday to protect against capital flight as Russia's war on the country pushes into a third month.

The National Bank of Ukraine is banning bitcoin purchases made with the hyrvnia and is capping purchases made with foreign currencies at $3,300 a month, Cointelegraph first reported.

The central bank said such measures are necessary to prevent capital outflows and to reduce pressure on Ukraine's foreign-currency reserves. The NBU also labeled bitcoin purchases as ""quasi cash transactions.""

The NBU isn't the first institution in Ukraine to move to ban bitcoin purchases. PirvatBank, the country's premier commercial bank in the country, stopped its customers from purchasing bitcoin with hyrvnia in March.

The move comes as Russia's war on Ukraine has ravaged its economy. Earlier this month, the World Bank estimated that Ukraine's GDP is expected to collapse by 45% this year.

Meanwhile, Ukraine's new crypto limits follow its prior embrace of cryptocurrencies since the Russia invasion, which sparked an influx of donations through digital tokens.

But only a fraction of the Central American nation’s businesses have taken a bitcoin payment and technical problems have plagued the government’s cryptocurrency app, frustrating even committed users of the technology.

Construction worker Adalberto Galvez, 32, said he had lost $220 when trying to withdraw cash from the Chivo digital wallet.

Like Galvez, dozens of Salvadorans told Reuters they had at least one problem with Chivo, named after the local word for “good”, and few had used it on a daily basis.

“It took my money but gave me nothing,” said Galvez, who had already been using bitcoin successfully for months with another application at an experimental small-scale bitcoin economy project dubbed Bitcoin Beach in the coastal town of El Zonte.

Galvez said the funds had been taken from his Bitcoin Beach wallet but he was never able to withdraw the cash via Chivo. He said he had not heard back after he filed complaints.

Others have also reported irregularities with transactions and attempts of stolen identity. President Nayib Bukele has blamed high demand for the issues Galvez and others have faced.

A spokesperson for the president’s office and Chivo could not be reached for comment.

By some measures adoption in the poor country, where one fifth of families depends on remittances, has been rapid.

Bukele has said three million people have downloaded Chivo, some 500,000 more than initially targeted and roughly half the country’s population. In September he said the wallet had 2.1 million active users.

One month since launch, 12 percent of consumers have used the cryptocurrency, the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development reported.

“Since yesterday, Salvadorans are inserting more cash (to buy #bitcoin) than what they are withdrawing from the @chivowallet ATMs,” Bukele tweeted on Wednesday. “This is very surprising so early in the game.”

But the foundation, which polled 233 companies across different sectors, found that the overall use was still low, with 93 percent of companies reporting no bitcoin payments.

“We’re still not sure what benefits the government expected,” said Leonor Selva of the National Association of Private Enterprises, one of several business groups that remains skeptical about the rollout.

Migrant money

The Bukele government hopes that 2.5 million Salvadorans living in the United States will eventually send remittances through Chivo.

So far, 30 bitcoin ATMs to send remittances have been installed in Atlanta, Chicago, Houston and Los Angeles and Bukele says around $2 million is being sent via Chivo daily.

Juan Moz, a construction worker who has lived in the United States since 2005, recently chose Chivo to send remittances home to his family — a decision he said saves him up to $18 when compared to traditional money transfer services.

“I’m definitely going to keep using it,” he said in a phone interview from San Francisco.

However, most of El Salvador’s $6 billion dollars annual remittances — about a quarter of the nation’s gross domestic product — still comes via money transfers, with many wary of the cryptocurrency’s volatility.

Last month, El Salvador bought 700 bitcoins. Prices initially dropped sharply after the Sept. 7 adoption but surged in late September to reach about $54,000 per coin this week.

Several people told Reuters they had downloaded the wallet and received a $30 bonus that the government offered at the outset of the program.

The handout was big enough that it benefited some small business owners like Alexander Diaz, whose restaurant serving chicken wings saw a spike in business.

“Most of the people who had that bonus wanted to test how it could be spent, so several clients made payments to us with bitcoin,” Diaz said, adding that some 20 percent of his customers now use the cryptocurrency.

“Chivo has benefited small entrepreneurs because it makes the payment method easier for customers,” Diaz said.

On September 7, 2021, El Salvador’s Bitcoin Law granting the currency legal tender status went into effect. Remarkably, in just one month, there are more Salvadorans with bitcoin wallets than traditional bank accounts.

After Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele announced that the country would adopt bitcoin as an official currency, there were doubters at home and abroad.

Opponents of Bukele’s government protested the move, vandalizing one of the Chivo ATM machines that Salvadorans can use to exchange bitcoin for U.S. dollars (El Salvador’s other official currency). Mary Anastasia O’Grady, Americas columnist for the Wall Street Journal, described the Bitcoin Law as a “scam,” mocking Chivo’s “rocky start.”

It appears, however, that supporters of the Bitcoin Law may have the last laugh.

Three million people have downloaded the Chivo bitcoin wallet, according to Bukele, amounting to 46 percent of the population. By contrast, as of 2017, only 29 percent of Salvadorans had bank accounts.

Notably, Salvadorans appear to be converting U.S. dollars into bitcoin and holding onto the digital currency, according to Bukele. “The incoming USD quadruples the outflow,” tweeted Bukele on October 6.

The Chivo numbers don’t tell the complete story. Salvadorans don’t have to use Chivo, the government’s officially sponsored bitcoin wallet, if they don’t want to. Any Lightning Network-enabled bitcoin wallet, such as the Bitcoin Beach Wallet or Jack Maller’s Strike can be used to interact with Salvadoran merchants.

Bitcoin adoption is likely to continue to rise in El Salvador; on September 29, Bukele announced that Chivo had “negotiated with the largest gas stations in the country” to reduce the price of gasoline by 20 cents per gallon for those who pay through the app. That’s on top of the $30 in seed money that the government has deposited in every Salvadoran’s Chivo account.

There remain hurdles to universal bitcoin usage in El Salvador. Merchant adoption remains gradual; a survey by the Salvadoran Foundation for Economic and Social Development found that 93 percent of Salvadoran companies reported receiving no payments in bitcoin. And the Chivo wallet enables instantaneous conversion of bitcoin to and from dollars, obviating the need for consumers to spend or save in dollars if they don’t want to.

Nonetheless, the wide adoption of the Chivo wallet is impressive, especially in comparison to traditional banking: as Bukele says, “very surprising so early in the game,” especially in September, when bitcoin’s price did not appreciate.

Most importantly, the impact of Chivo is likely greater among low-income Salvadorans who have access to smartphones but not banks. Among El Salvador’s two poorest quintiles, many of whom live in rural areas, only 6 percent have bank accounts. If El Salvador’s poorest can benefit from bitcoin, everyone can.","Customers wait to use a Chivo Bitcoin automated teller machine (ATM) at Plaza Salvador del Mundo in San Salvador, El Salvador, on Wednesday, Sept. 29, 2021.

Con distintas connotaciones en contra de parte de ARENA sobre el uso legal de la moneda virtual Bitcoin, la Asamblea aprob� con votos de los diputados oficialistas el proyecto de ley enviado este mismo martes a la Asamblea, para que esa moneda se implemente en El Salvador de forma paralela al d�lar.

Seg�n el decreto, el uso del Bitcoin ser� “irrestricto con poder liberatorio, ilimitado en cualquier transacci�n y a cualquier t�tulo que las personas naturales o jur�dicas p�blicas o privadas requieran realizar”.

VER: Todo negocio deber� aceptar el Bitcoin como forma de pago y las obligaciones del Estado, como deudas y pensiones, tambi�n se pagar�n con esta moneda

En la discusi�n que realizaron los diputados de la comisi�n Financiera, la bancada de Nuevas Ideas justific� que el Bitcoin no sustituir� al d�lar. “Solo es un valor agregado”, argument� el diputado H�ctor Sales de Nuevas Ideas.

�Qu� contiene el proyecto de ley?

El documento especifica que el tipo de cambio entre el Bitcoin y el d�lar de los Estados Unidos ser� establecido libremente por el mercado; que todo precio podr� ser expresado en bitcoin; y que todas las contribuciones tributarias podr�n ser pagadas en bitcoin.

Dice que sin perjuicio del sector privado, el Estado proveer� alternativas que permitan al usuario llevar a cabo transacciones en bitcoin, as� como contar con convertibilidad autom�tica e instant�nea de bitcoin a d�lar en caso de que lo desee.

Quienes quedar�n excluidos de la obligaci�n expresada de aceptar bitcoin como una forma de pago cuando as� le sea ofrecido por quien adquiere un bien o servicio son quienes por hecho “notorio y de manera evidente no tengan acceso a las tecnolog�as que permitan ejecutar transacciones en bitcoin”.

En esto, el diputado Rodrigo Ávila, de ARENA, recomend� escuchar a expertos cibern�ticos, ya que as� como est� redactada la ley se obliga a cualquier persona que posea una computadora o un tel�fono a aceptar bitcoin para cualquier transacci�n.

El proyecto de ley dice que todas las obligaciones en dinero expresadas en d�lares, existentes con anterioridad a la vigencia de la presente ley podr�n ser pagadas en bitcoin, es decir, retroactiva.

Faculta a Bandesal tambi�n a garantizar a trav�s de la creaci�n de un Fideicomiso la convertibilidad autom�tica e instant�nea de bitcoin a d�lar de las alternativas provistas por el Estado.

Los diputados de la oposici�n reclamaron que no se le ha dado un mayor margen de estudio al proyecto de ley considerando que ser� la primera legislaci�n de ese tipo en el mundo, dijo Anabel Belloso, diputada del FMLN.

Cuestion� que la redacci�n tiene muchos cuestionamientos y que no habr� oportunidad de subsanarlos.

Ávila explic� que la moneda virtual tal como lo han dicho economistas es “muy vol�til” y existen riesgos latentes a que ese mecanismo se pueda prestar a lavado de dinero, narcotr�fico y otros delitos financieros.

Explic� que deber�a escucharse a expertos economistas en el ciber crimen y comunidades tecnol�gicas y no aprobar algo tan delicado de forma expresa.

Sin embargo, los diputados de Nuevas Ideas hicieron caso omiso de las recomendaciones y dijeron que la modalidad es novedosa y que despu�s de que El Salvador la implemente vendr�n otros pa�ses del mundo a replicar lo mismo. “No tengo duda de que las mentes m�s brillantes del pa�s apoyar�n este proceso”, expres� el diputado de Nuevas Ideas, William Soriano.

TAMBIÉN: Bandesal ser� la “casa de cambio” para hacer efectivos los Bitcoins, seg�n propuesta de ley

Sobre el riesgo que el bitcoin sea usado por el crimen organizado y el narcotr�fico, el diputado Caleb Navarro, de Nuevas Ideas, de forma ir�nica record� que hay “expedientes judiciales donde se dice que con bolsas negras salieron de un banco lavando dinero”.

La ley fue aprobada horas despu�s de que el mismo presidente del Banco Central de Reserva, Douglas Rodr�guez, admitiera en una entrevista televisiva de un medio estatal que la criptomoneda Bitcoin tiene “volatilidad bastante alta”.

“Volatilidad en el bitcoin s� existe, hay una volatilidad bastante alta, pero eso pasa tambi�n hasta en el d�lar, hasta en las mejores monedas tambi�n existe volatilidad, existe ese efecto de que pueda bajar o pueda subir, no necesariamente se va a estancar"", admiti� Rodr�guez.

Europe’s highest court ruled in response to a request by Swedish tax authorities, who had argued bitcoin transactions should not be covered by a European Union directive exempting currency transactions from value added tax (VAT).

The court ruled that bitcoins should be treated as a means of payment, and as such were protected under the directive.

Küll aga tuleb põhjalikumalt analüüsida Komisjoni väljapakutud neljanda rahapesu tõkestamise direktiivi (AMLD IV) sellesisulisi punkte, seisab dokumendis.

Virtuaalvaluuta või virtuaalvääringu mõistet ei ole Euroopa Liidus seni õiguslikult reguleeritud ja liikmesriikide praktika on olnud väga erinev. Peamised õiguslikud küsimused on tekkinud seoses säärases väärtingus tehtud tehingute maksustamise ning rahapesu ja terrorismi rahastamise tõkestamise reeglite osas virtuaalvaluutade puhul.

Ühe tuntuima virtuaalvääringu Bitcoini osas on Euroopa Kohus teinud otsuse, mille järgi on tavavaluuta vahetamine bitcoini vastu ja teistpidi käibemaksust vabastatud. Selle põhimõtte on samale otsusele viidates üle võtnud ka Eesti.

Enda seisukoha on selles küsimuses esitanud ka maksu- ja tolliamet (MTA), mis käsitleb virtuaalvääringut varana. Seetõttu tuleb ameti hinnangul tulumaksuga maksustada vara võõrandamisest või vahendamisest saadud kasu ning kui säärane tegevus vastab ettevõtlustulu tingimustele, tuleb see ka MTA hinnangul säärase tuluna maksustada.

Rahapesu ja terrorismi rahastamise tõkestamise osas märkis rahandusministeerium analüüsis, et virtuaalvääringuid on Eestis käsitletud alternatiivsete maksevahenditena. Seetõttu peavad sääraste valuutadega kauplejad muuhulgas tuvastama ostja isiku ärisuhte loomisel või juhul, kui ostja soetab valuutat enam kui 1000 euro eest kuus.

Virtuaalvaluutade kasutajate esindusorganisatsiooni Eesti Krüptoraha Liidu sõnul on säärased nõuded bitcoinidega kauplejatele liialt suur koormus. Rahandusministeerium märgib samas, et iseenesest rahapesureeglid bitcoinide kauplemisele otseseid piiranguid ei sea ning nõuded isikusamasuse tuvastamiseks on juba lihtsustunud.

Euroopa Komisjoni uute ettepanekute seas rahapesu tõkestamise neljanda direktiivi loomisel on ka säte, mille järgi hakkaks direktiiv reguleerima ka virtuaalvaluutade vahendamise platvorme ja digitaalse rahakoti pakkujaid (custodian wallet providers). Ettepaneku järgi peaksid säärased ettevõtted hakkama taotlema tegevusluba või ennast registreerima.

Seejärel peaksid sellised platvormid ja rahakotipakkujad hakkama klientide suhtes rakendama hoolsusmeetmeid ning nende üle teostataks järelevalveid. Euroopa Komisjoni ettepanekuid plaanib rahandusministeerium Eesti kontekstis täiendavalt eraldi analüüsida ning töötada seisukohad välja hiljemalt 2016. aasta septembris.","In the analysis, the Ministry of Finance did not identify fundamental legal obstacles that would prevent or make transactions with virtual currency payments.However, in more detail, the Commission's fourth money laundering Prevention Directive (AMLD IV) should be analyzed in more detail, the document states.

The concept of virtual currency or virtual currency has not yet been legally regulated in the European Union and the practice of Member States has been very different.The main legal issues have arisen with regard to the taxation of transactions made in such a value and the rules for the prevention of money laundering and terrorist funding for virtual currency.

As for one of the most well -known virtual value Bitcoin, the European Court of Justice has made a decision that the exchange of ordinary currency against Bitcoin and, on the other hand, has been exempt from VAT.Estonia has taken over this principle, referring to the same decision.

The Tax and Customs Board (MTA), which treats virtual currency as property, has also made its own position on this issue.Therefore, according to the Agency, the benefits from the transfer or brokerage of the property should be taxed on income tax, and if such an activity meets the terms of business income, it must also be taxed as such income.

Regarding the prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, the Ministry of Finance said in an analysis that virtual values have been considered as alternative payments in Estonia.Therefore, traders with such currencies must, among other things, identify the buyer in the establishment of a person's business relationship or if the buyer acquires a currency for more than 1000 euros per month.

According to the Estonian Cryptocurrency Association, the representative organization of virtual currency users, such requirements for traders with bitcoins are too high.At the same time, the Ministry of Finance notes that the money laundering rules in itself do not impose direct restrictions on Bitcoin trading and the requirements for identifying identity have already been simplified.

Among the new proposals of the European Commission, the creation of a fourth directive for money laundering is also a provision that the Directive would also regulate virtual currency mediation platforms and digital wallet providers (Custom Wallet Providers).According to the proposal, such companies should start applying for a license or registering themselves.

Subsequently, such platforms and wallet providers should take care of the customers and will be supervised.The Ministry of Finance plans to further analyze the proposals of the European Commission in the Estonian context and to develop positions by September 2016 at the latest.",0,"[('virtual', 0.04537402), ('financial', 0.028159728), ('risk', 0.027705299), ('european', 0.022151865), ('legal', 0.022136075), ('issued', 0.022047507), ('authority', 0.018713262), ('3', 0.018013643), ('central', 0.017341798), ('trading', 0.015194941)]",0,"[('use', 0.062151197), ('copyright', 0.024864022), ('library', 0.019866286), ('government', 0.019797979), ('item', 0.018867392), ('law', 0.018566867), ('bitcoin', 0.017421842), ('reuse', 0.017286222), ('right', 0.016354026), ('permission', 0.016217122)]"

1 Johdanto

1.1 Ohjeen sisältö

Markkinoille on ilmestynyt viime vuosina erilaisia virtuaali- tai vertaisvaluutoiksi kutsuttuja tuotteita, joita käytetään vaihdannan välineinä oikean valuutan tapaisesti. Tässä ohjeessa käsitellään virtuaalivaluuttojen tuloverotusta eri käyttötilanteissa. Esimerkkinä ohjeessa käytetään pääasiassa bitcoinia, joka lienee yleisin markkinoilla oleva virtuaalivaluutta, mutta soveltuvin osin samoja periaatteita sovelletaan verotuksessa myös muihin käytössä oleviin virtuaalivaluuttoihin.

Ohjeessa käsitellään myös internet-peleissä käytettävien omien virtuaalivaluuttojen verotustilanteita lukuun ottamatta varsinaisia peliyhtiöiden järjestämiä rahapelejä. Tässä ohjeessa ei siten käsitellä varsinaisista raha-automaattipeleistä tai muista sellaisia rahapeleistä saatavia tuloja. Esimerkiksi pokeripeleistä saatujen tulojen verotusta on käsitelty 6.10.2008 annetussa Verohallinnon ohjeessa Pokeritulojen verotuksesta, diaarinumero 1329/31/2008.

1.2 Yleistä virtuaalivaluuttojen luonteesta

Verohallinnon julkaisussa ”Harmaan talouden tilannekuva 3/2011” on selvitetty muun muassa bitcoin virtuaalivaluutan luonnetta ja käyttöä maksuvälineenä.

Julkaisun mukaan bitcoin on vertaisverkon avulla luotu virtuaalinen raha – vaihdannan väline, jota ei ole olemassa kolikkoina tai seteleinä. Vertaisverkossa välitettävä raha liikkuu käyttäjiensä välillä kuten esimerkiksi pankkikorttimaksu, mutta ilman välikäsiä, joita normaalissa rahaliikenteessä ovat pankit. Päinvastoin kuin perinteisissä maksuvälineissä, bitcoinin arvoa eivät määrittele eri maiden keskuspankit, vaan valuutan arvo määräytyy kysynnän ja tarjonnan perusteella. Bitcoin siirtyy vertaisverkossa henkilöltä toiselle, eikä sitä ole sidottu pankkien valuutanvaihtokursseihin.

2 Virtuaalivaluuttojen tuloverotus eri tilanteissa

2.1 Virtuaalivaluutta tuloverotuksessa

Olemassa olevat virtuaalivaluutat eivät ole oikeaa, virallista valuuttaa. Virtuaalivaluuttaa ei ole laskenut liikkeelle minkään valtion keskuspankki. Kirjapitovelvollisia ei myöskään ole velvoitettu ottamaan vastaan virtuaalivaluuttaa maksuvälineenä. Virtuaalivaluutta siirtyy vertaisverkossa henkilöltä toiselle, eikä sen arvoa ole sidottu pankkien valuutanvaihtokursseihin, vaan sen arvo suhteessa virallisiin valuuttoihin määräytyy virtuaalivaluutan kysynnän ja tarjonnan perusteella.



Myös Kirjanpitolautakunta on kirjanpitovelvollisille 23.10.2012 antamassaan lausunnossa (numero 1895) ”Digitaalisen vertaisvaluutan käsittelystä kirjanpidossa” todennut, että vertaisvaluutta ei ole virallinen maksuväline (euro). Tahdonvaltaisuudesta kuitenkin johtuu, että osapuolet voivat sopia hyväksyvänsä vertaisvaluutan kirjanpitovelvollisen luovuttaman suoritteen maksuna.

Virtuaalivaluutat eivät ole rahaa mutta eivät myöskään arvopapereita tuloverolaissa (TVL) tarkoitetulla tavalla. Tämän vuoksi virtuaalivaluuttaa pidetään tuloverolain soveltamistilanteissa luonteeltaan muuna, erikseen määrittelemättömänä ja sen käyttäjien välisenä sopimuksena. Sopimussuhteeseen liittyvät menetykset eivät ole tuloverolain mukaisessa verotuksessa vähennyskelpoisia.

Virtuaalivaluuttojen vaihto voi tapahtua käytännössä joko olemassa oleviin virallisiin valuuttoihin, hyödykkeisiin tai palveluihin. Käytännössä virtuaalivaluutan käyttöalaa ei ole rajoitettu, vaan sen käyttö kuuluu osapuolten sopimusvapauden piiriin. Virtuaalivaluutan käyttö missä tahansa vaihdantatilanteessa realisoi sen arvonnousun verotuksen.

Tuloverolain 29 §:n mukaan veronalaista tuloa ovat verovelvollisen rahana tai rahanarvoisena etuutena saamat tulot. Rahana tai rahanarvoisena etuutena saatu tulo on siten veronalaista, jollei sitä ole erikseen säädetty verovapaaksi. Virtuaalivaluuttojen realisoitunut arvonnousu on veronalaista pääomatuloa, kuten alla on eri käyttötilanteissa tarkemmin selvitetty.

2.1.1 Oikean valuutan ja virtuaalivaluutan vaihtotilanteet

Virtuaalivaluutan kaupassa osapuolina ovat suoraan myyjä ja ostaja. Kauppaa ei käydä arvopaperipörssissä tai muualla julkisesti listatuilla markkinoilla, eikä kaupan ehtoja siten määritellä markkinapaikan ehdoissa.

TVL 32 §:n mukaan veronalaista pääomatuloa on omaisuuden tuotto, omaisuuden luovutuksesta saatu voitto ja muu sellainen tulo, jota varallisuuden voidaan katsoa kerryttäneen. Virtuaalivaluutan kauppatilanteissa ei sovelleta virtuaalivaluutan sopimusluonteen vuoksi tuloverolain omaisuuden luovutusvoittojen verottamista koskevia säännöksiä.

Virtuaalivaluutan muuntaminen oikeaksi valuutaksi realisoi virtuaalivaluutan arvonmuutoksen verotuksen. Positiivista arvonousua voidaan pitää varallisuuden kerryttämänä tulona, jolloin arvonnousu verotetaan muuna pääomatulona. Arvonmuutosta laskettaessa katsotaan virtuaalivaluuttaa käytetyksi siinä järjestyksessä kuin henkilö on sitä hankkinut, jos hän ei muuta näytä.

Esimerkki 1: Henkilö on aikanaan ostanut 500 eurolla 1 000 bitcoinia, eli yksi bitcoin maksoi siis 0,5 euroa. Hän on myöhemmin ostanut lisää 500 bitcoinia 500 eurolla, eli yhdellä eurolla sai tuolloin yhden bitcoinin. Hänellä on hankintojen jälkeen omistuksessaan 1 500 bitcoinia. Hän myy 1 200 bitcoinia hetkellä, jolloin yksi bitcoin maksaa 1,5 euroa. Virtuaalivaluutan myynti realisoi arvonmuutoksen verotuksen, jolloin hänelle syntyy tässä tilanteessa pääomatulona verotettavaa tuloa 1 800 euroa – (500 euroa + 200 euroa) = 1 100 euroa. Henkilöllä on kaupan jälkeen vielä hallussaan 300 bitcoinia, jotka on hankittu 300 eurolla.

Virtuaalivaluutan arvonnousu on kokonaan veronalaista pääomatuloa. TVL 53 §:n 1 momentin 8 kohdan mukaista, valuuttakurssivoittoja koskevaa verovapaussäännöstä ei voida soveltaa virtuaalivaluuttojen vaihtotilanteisiin, koska virtuaalivaluutta ei ole oikea, virallinen valuutta.

Tuloverolain mukaan toimitettavassa verotuksessa menetykset ovat lähtökohtaisesti vähennyskelvottomia. TVL 50 §:n 3 momentin 3 kohdan mukaan luovutustappiona saadaan kuitenkin vähentää sellainen arvopaperin arvonmenetys, jota voidaan konkurssin tai muun siihen verrattavan syyn vuoksi pitää lopullisena. Virtuaalivaluutta ei ole tuloverolaissa tarkoitettu arvopaperi. Virtuaalivaluutan vaihtamisen yhteydessä syntyvää mahdollista arvonlaskua ei siten voida vähentää tuloverotuksessa TVL 50 §:n luovutustappiota koskevien säännösten mukaan. Virtuaalivaluutan arvonlasku ei ole muullakaan perusteella tuloverotuksessa vähennyskelpoinen.

Verotuksellisesti virtuaalivaluutan kauppa muistuttaa olosuhteiltaan niin sanotuilla hinnanerosopimuksilla (CFD) käytävää kauppaa. Korkein hallinto-oikeus katsoi hinnanerosopimuksen verotusta koskevassa vuosikirjaratkaisussaan KHO:2010:74, että hinnanerosopimuksesta koituva meno ei ollut tuloverolain 54 §:ssä tarkoitettu tulon hankkimisesta tai säilyttämisestä johtuva meno, eikä myöskään tuloverolain 50 §:ssä tarkoitettu luovutustappio tai muu vähennyskelpoinen luovutustappioon rinnastettava tappio.

KHO 2010:74:

A kävi sivutoimisesti arvopaperikauppaa ja teki sijoituksia erilaisiin arvopapereihin ja sijoitusinstrumentteihin kuten CFD-sijoitusinstrumentteihin (Contract for Difference, hinnanerosopimus). CFD on hinnanerosopimus, jolla ei oleerääntymispäivää eikä ennalta sovittua hintaa, vaan sen hinnanmuutos vastaa kohdeinstrumentin kurssin kehitystä. Kaupankäynti CFD-instrumenteilla ei tapahdu julkisesti listatuilla markkinoilla. Keskusverolautakunnan tältä osin lainvoimaiseksi jääneessä ennakkoratkaisussa oli todettu, että A:lle tästä sopimuksesta kertyvä tulo oli tuloverolain 32 §:n mukaista pääomatuloa. Korkein hallinto-oikeus pysytti keskusverolautakunnan ennakkoratkaisun myös siltä osin kun siinä oli katsottu, ettei A:lle CFD-sopimuksesta koituva meno ollut tuloverolain 54 §:ssä tarkoitettu tulon hankkimisesta tai säilyttämisestä johtuva meno eikä myöskään tuloverolain 50 §:ssä tarkoitettuna luovutustappiona tai muuna luovutustappioon rinnastettavana tappiona vähennyskelpoinen. Ennakkoratkaisu verovuosille 2009 ja 2010. Tuloverolaki 50 ja 54 §

2.1.2 Virtuaalivaluutan käyttö hyödykkeiden tai palvelujen hankintaan

Jotkut yritykset hyväksyvät maksuvälineeksi virtuaalivaluutan. Näiden yritysten joukossa on niin tavallisia liikkeitä, kuin myös internetissä toimivia verkkokauppoja. Verotuksellisesti ostosten suorittamisessa virtuaalivaluutalla on kyse sopimukseen perustuvasta vaihdosta, jossa virtuaalivaluutta vaihdetaan joko hyödykkeisiin tai palveluihin. Vaihto realisoi virtuaalivaluutan mahdollisen arvonnousun verottamisen pääomatulona.

Esimerkki 2: Henkilö on aikanaan ostanut 1 000 eurolla bitcoineja, jolloin yhdellä eurolla sai kaksi bitcoinia. Yksi bitcoin maksoi siis 0,5 euroa. Hänellä on hankinnan jälkeen omistuksessaan 2 000 bitcoinia. Hän ostaa nettikaupasta tavaroita yhteensä 1 000 bitcoinilla hetkellä, jolloin bitcoinit maksavat kymmenen euroa kappaleelta. Hän ostaa siis tavaroita yhteensä 10 000 euron arvosta. Tavaroiden osto realisoi virtuaalivaluutan arvonmuutoksen verotuksen, jolloin hänelle syntyy tässä tilanteessa pääomatulona verotettavaa tuloa 10 000 euroa - 500 euroa = 9 500 euroa. Henkilölle jäi ostosten tekemisen jälkeen vielä jäljelle 1 000 bitcoinia, joiden hankintahinta on ollut 500 euroa.

Esimerkki 3: Henkilö on ostanut aiemmin 1 000 eurolla bitcoineja yhteensä 100 kappaletta. Yhden bitcoinin hinta oli siten kymmenen euroa. Hän ostaa myöhemmin nettikaupasta tavaroita yhteensä 100 bitcoinilla hetkellä, jolloin bitcoin maksaa viisi euroa kappaleelta. Hän ostaa siis tavaraa yhteensä 500 euron arvosta. Bitcoinien arvonmuutos henkilön omistusaikana on ollut 500 euroa negatiivinen, mutta tätä ei voida verotuksessa vahvistaa tappioksi. Virtuaalivaluutan arvonlasku ei ole muullakaan perusteella tuloverotuksessa vähennyskelpoista.

2.1.3 Virtuaalivaluuttojen ja luovutusvoittojen yhteensovittaminen

Luovutusvoitto katsotaan sen verovuoden tuloksi, jona kauppa tai vaihto on tehty tai muu luovutus on tapahtunut. Tuloveroseuraamukset määritetään aina euromääräisesti, vaikka kauppahinta suoritettaisiin virtuaalivaluuttana. Tällainen tilanne on esimerkiksi henkilöiden kesken tehty arvopaperikauppa.

Luovutustilanteissa omaisuuden hankintameno on se määrä, joka siitä olisi maksettu euromääräisesti. Verovelvollisen on esitettävä selvitys hankintamenosta oikeassa valuutassa (euroina) omaisuuden ostohetkellä. Omaisuuden myynnin yhteydessä mahdollisesti käytettävä virtuaalivaluutta muunnetaan myyntihetken vaihtokurssilla takaisin oikeaksi rahaksi. Siten omaisuuden luovutusvoitot ja -tappiot määritetään suoraan euromääräisesti kaupan tekemishetkellä.

Kaupassa käytetyn virtuaalivaluutan arvonnousu verotetaan erikseen henkilön pääomatulona. Mahdollinen virtuaalivaluutan positiivinen arvonmuuton osto- ja myyntihetkellä realisoituu verotuksessa, kuten edellä kappaleessa 2.1.1 on todettu (katso myös esimerkit 1. - 3. kappaleissa 2.1.1 ja 2.1.2). Virtuaalivaluutan avulla tehtyjen kauppojen tappiot jätetään vahvistamatta siltä osin kun tappio johtuu virtuaalivaluutan arvonmuutoksesta

Esimerkki 4: Todellisuudessa voitollisesta osakkeiden kaupasta syntyy ”tappiota” bitcoineina. Henkilö ostaa yhtiön A osakkeita 1 000 kappaletta hintaan kymmenen euroa/osake eli hankintahinta on yhteensä 10 000 euroa. Hän maksaa osakkeet bitcoineilla, joita hän oli hankkinut 10 000 eurolla 2 000 kappaletta. Yksi bitcoin maksoi siis viisi euroa. Muita bitcoineja henkilöllä ei ole hallussaan. Henkilö myy osakkeet myöhemmin hintaan 1 000 bitcoinia. Myyntihetkellä osakkeen kurssi oli 12 euroa osakkeelta eli myyntihinta euroissa olisi ollut 12 000 euroa. Osakkeiden myyntihetkellä yksi bitcoin maksoi 12 euroa. Osakkeiden kaupasta syntyy siis todellisuudessa 2 000 euron (= 12 000 euroa – 10 000 euroa) veronalainen luovutusvoitto. Kaupat on kuitenkin toteutettu bitcoineina, jolloin kaupasta syntyi 1 000 bitcoinin suuruinen ”tappio”. Tätä ”tappiota” ei verotuksessa vahvisteta. Henkilöllä on kaupan jälkeen omistuksessaan vielä 1 000 bitcoinia, joiden saantohetken arvo on 12 000 euroa. Jos nämä bitcoinit vaihdetaan myöhemmin rahaksi tai arvonnousu muutoin realisoituu esimerkiksi tavarahankintojen yhteydessä (katso kohta 2.1.3), mahdollinen arvonnousu verotetaan pääomatulona. Jos rahaksi vaihdosta syntyy ”tappiota”, sitä ei verotuksessa vahvisteta.

Esimerkki 5: Todellisuudessa tappiolliset osakekaupat Henkilö ostaa yhtiön B osakkeita 1 000 kappaletta hintaan kymmenen euroa/osake eli hankintahinta on yhteensä 10 000 euroa. Hankinta maksetaan kuitenkin myyjälle bitcoineina, jotka on vaihdettu tätä tarkoitusta varten samana päivänä. Tällöin 10 000 eurolla sai 2 000 bitcoinia. Yksi bitcoin maksoi siis viisi euroa. Muita bitcoineja henkilöllä ei ole hallussaan. Henkilö myy osakkeet myöhemmin hintaan 1 500 bitcoinia. Myyntihetkellä osakkeen kurssi oli kuusi euroa osakkeelta eli myyntihinta euroissa on ollut 6 000 euroa. Myyntihetkellä yksi bitcoin maksoi neljä euroa. Osakkeiden kaupasta syntyy siis todellisuudessa 4 000 euron (= 6 000 euroa – 10 000 euroa) suuruinen luovutustappio, joka vahvistetaan verotuksessa. Henkilö sai osakemyynnin seurauksena omistukseensa 1 500 bitcoinia, joiden arvo niiden saannon hetkellä oli 6 000 euroa. Jos nämä bitcoinit vaihdetaan myöhemmin rahaksi tai arvonnousu muutoin realisoituu esimerkiksi tavarahankintojen yhteydessä (katso kohta 2.1.3.), mahdollinen arvonnousu verotetaan pääomatulona. Jos virtuaalivaluutan rahaksi vaihdosta syntyy ”tappiota”, sitä ei verotuksessa vahvisteta.

Esimerkki 6: Todellisuudessa tappiollinen osakekauppa, mutta bitcoineissa laskettuna syntyy ”voittoa”. Henkilö ostaa yhtiön C osakkeita 1 000 kappaletta hintaan kymmenen euroa/osake eli hankintahinta yhteensä 10 000 euroa. Hankinta maksetaan kuitenkin myyjälle bitcoineina, jotka on vaihdettu tätä tarkoitusta varten samana päivänä. Tällöin 10 000 eurolla sai 2 000 bitcoinia. Yksi bitcoin maksoi siis viisi euroa. Muita bitcoineja henkilöllä ei ole hallussaan. Osakkeet myydään myöhemmin hintaan 2 500 bitcoinia. Myyntihetkellä osakkeen kurssi oli 7,50 euroa osakkeelta eli myyntihinta euroissa olisi ollut yhteensä 7 500 euroa. Myyntihetkellä yksi bitcoin maksoi kolme euroa. Kaupasta syntyy siis todellisuudessa 2 500 euron (= 7 500 euroa – 10 000 euroa) luovutustappio, joka vahvistetaan verotuksessa. Bitcoineina laskettuna ”voittoa” syntyisi 500 bitcoinin verran, mutta tässä tilanteessa ”voitto” ei ole arvonlaskusta johtuen todellinen. Tätä ei erikseen huomioida verotusta toimitettaessa. Henkilö saa kuitenkin osakkeiden myynnistä vastikkeeksi 2 500 bitcoinia, joiden arvo saannon hetkellä oli 7 500 euroa. Jos bitcoinit vaihdetaan myöhemmin rahaksi tai arvonnousu muutoin realisoituu esimerkiksi tavarahankintojen yhteydessä (katso kohta 2.1.3.), mahdollinen arvonnousu verotetaan pääomatulona. Jos rahaksi vaihdosta syntyy ”tappiota”, sitä ei verotuksessa vahvisteta.

2.1.4 Virtuaalivaluutan ”louhintaan” osallistumisesta saatujen varojen verotus

Bitcoin -järjestelmässä syntyy uusia valuuttayksiköitä monimutkaiseen algoritmiin perustuvan ohjelman säätelemänä. Sen avulla bitcoin -verkoston jäsenet voivat ”louhimiseksi” kutsutulla menetelmällä hankkia uusia bitcoineja luovuttamalla verkostolle tietokoneensa laskentatehoa käytettäväksi. Tällöin verkoston jäsen saa vastineeksi algoritmin luomia bitcoineja rahaliikenteen ylläpidosta. Uusia virtuaalivaluuttoja jaetaan järjestelmään osallistuvien kesken käytännössä sattumanvaraisesti.

Louhimisesta vastineeksi virtuaalivaluuttana saatua tuloa ei voida pitää varallisuuden kerryttämänä. Tuloverolain 61 §:n mukaan ansiotuloa on muu tulo kuin pääomatulo. Siten louhintaan osallistumisesta saatava tulo on saajansa ansiotuloa. Louhinnasta saatu tulo realisoituu verotettavaksi sillä hetkellä, kun henkilö saa virtuaalivaluutan vallintaansa. Virtuaalivaluutan arvona käytetään saantohetken mukaista vaihtokurssia.

2.1.5 Internet-peleistä saatujen tulojen verottaminen

Internetissä on lukuisa määrä erilaisia pelejä tai ohjelmia, joissa käytetään omia sisäisiä virtuaalivaluuttoja ja joiden tuloja ei käsitellä arpajaisvoittoina. Tässä ohjeessa käsiteltäviä Internet-pelejä ja -ohjelmia kutsutaan peleiksi riippumatta siitä, millaisesta ohjelmasta on tosiasiallisesti kyse.

Useat näistä peleistä tarjoavat mahdollisuuden sille, että pelaaja (ohjelman käyttäjä) voi ansaita virtuaalivaluuttaa omalla aktiivisella toiminnallaan. Joissakin peleissä on myös mahdollisuus siihen, että pelin sisällä käytetty virtuaalivaluutta voidaan muuntaa oikeaksi rahaksi, tai pelaaja voi ansaita myymällä jotakin pelissä kehittämäänsä ominaisuutta toiselle pelaajalle oikealla rahalla.

TVL 110 §:n mukaan tulo katsotaan sen verovuoden tuloksi, jona se on nostettu, merkitty verovelvollisen tilille tai muutoin saatu vallintaan. Tässä ohjeessa tarkoitettuja yksittäisiä pelejä ja niiden pelaamiseen käytettyjä virtuaalivaluuttoja pidetään yhtenä ja samana pelikokonaisuutena. Tästä syystä virtuaalipelivoitot katsotaan saaduksi vallintaan TVL 110 §:ssä tarkoitetulla tavalla vasta sillä hetkellä, kun pelaaja kotiuttaa tulonsa pelistä. Tulojen veronalainen kotiuttaminen tapahtuu, kun pelissä käytettävä virtuaalivaluutta vaihdetaan pelin ulkopuolella oikeaksi rahaksi tai muuksi rahanarvoiseksi omaisuudeksi. Tulouttaminen tapahtuu ja veronalaisen ansiotulon määrä määräytyy virtuaalivaluutan tuloutushetken käyvän arvon mukaisesti.

Peleissä ansainta perustuu henkilökohtaiseen pelaamistoimintaan ja pelien perusteella kertynyt tulo on siten luonteeltaan ansiotuloa. Pelaaja voi vähentää verotuksessa tulonhankkimiskulunaan selvityksen perusteella vain sen osan sijoituksestaan, jonka perusteella tuloa on saatu.

Jos pelaamisesta ei ole kertynyt verotettavaa tuloa, eivät peliin sijoitettujen varojen menetys tai pelaamisesta muutoin aiheutuneet tappiot ole verotuksessa vähennyskelpoisia. Tällöin on kyse harrastustoiminnan menoista, joita pidetään elantomenoina. TVL 31 §:n 4 momentin mukaan elantomenot eivät ole verotuksessa vähennyskelpoisia.

2.2 Virtuaalivaluutta elinkeinoverotuksessa

2.2.1 Maksuna vastaanotettu virtuaalivaluutta

Kuten edellä kohdassa 1.2 on todettu, jotkut yritykset myös Suomessa hyväksyvät myymiensä tavaroiden ja palvelujen maksuvälineeksi eurojen lisäksi virtuaalivaluutan. Näiden yritysten joukossa on niin tavallisia liikkeitä, kuin myös internetissä toimivia verkkokauppoja.

Kirjanpitolautakunta on antanut 23.10.2012 digitaalisen vertaisvaluutan kirjanpidollisesta käsittelystä lausunnon (numero 1895). Hakijana oleva suomalainen tilitoimisto pyysi kirjanpitolautakunnalta lausuntoa siitä, kuinka tietoverkossa luotua vertaisvaluuttaa eli niin sanottua virtuaalirahaa tulee käsitellä yrityksen kirjanpidossa. Kirjanpitolautakunnan lausunnon mukaan virtuaalivaluuttaa voidaan luonnehtia käyttäjiensä väliseen sopimukseen perustuvaksi hyödykkeeksi. Vertaisvaluuttaa vastaanotettaessa näiden välineiden arvo muunnetaan Suomen rahaksi maksupäivän kurssiin niiden kirjanpitoon merkitsemistä varten, jos se on saatavilla; muussa tapauksessa osapuolten sopimaan arvoon.



Elinkeinotoiminnan suoritemyynnistä maksuksi saadun virtuaalivaluutan arvoksi katsotaan kirjanpitolautakunnan ohjeistusta vastaavalla tavalla virtuaalivaluutan käypä arvo maksupäivänä. Suoritemyynnistä saatu virtuaalivaluutta on lähtökohtaisesti elinkeinotoiminnan rahoitusomaisuutta.

Rahoitusomaisuuteen kuuluvan virtuaalivaluutan myynnistä saatu voitto on veronalaista elinkeinotoiminnan tuloa (elinkeinotulon verottamisesta annetun lain, EVL, 5 §:n 5 kohta). Myynnistä aiheutuva tappio on lopullisena menetyksenä vastaavasti vähennyskelpoista menoa (EVL 17 §:n 1 momentin 2 kohta).

2.2.2 Sijoitukset virtuaalivaluuttaan

Virtuaalivaluutalla harjoitettu sijoitustoiminta on muun sijoitustoiminnan tapaan lähtökohtaisesti yrityksen muun toiminnan tulolähteeseen kuuluvaa ja siihen sovelletaan tuloverolakia. Jos kyse on kassareservin tilapäisestä sijoittamisesta, varat katsotaan normaalisti rahoitusomaisuudeksi.

Jos yrityksen varsinaisena liiketoimintana on kaupankäynti virtuaalivaluutalla, on Verohallinnon yhtenäistämisohjeessa mainittujen arvopaperikauppaa koskevien edellytysten (jatkuvuus, suunnitelmallisuus, aktiivisuus, taloudellisen riskin ottaminen) täytyttävä, jotta tällainen toiminta voisi olla elinkeinotoimintaa ja virtuaalivaluutta verotuksessa yrityksen vaihto-omaisuutta.

3 Ilmoitusmenettely

Virtuaalivaluutan käyttäminen missä tahansa vaihtotilanteessa realisoi mahdollisen arvonnousun tuloverotuksen, kuten edellä on mainittu. Virtuaalivaluutta käytettäessä sopijaosapuolina on aina suoraan kaksi osapuolta, myyjä ja ostaja. Suomessa yleisesti verovelvollisen osapuolen, jolla tulo kulloinkin realisoituu verotettavaksi, on ilmoitettava itse saamansa tulo Verohallinnolle. Tulo on ilmoitettava siitä riippumatta, onko toinen osapuoli kotimainen vai ulkomainen ja missä maassa ja valuutassa ne ovat syntyneet ja missä maassa virtuaalivaluutta on. Ilmoitus on tehtävä viimeistään sen vuoden veroilmoituksella, jona tulon realisoituminen on tapahtunut.

It recommends using the term ""crypto token.""[14]: 41  In November 2019, a legislation passed by German parliament allows the banks to sell and store cryptocurrencies starting from 1 January 2020.[133]",132,cite_note-132,https://techcrunch.com/2013/08/19/germany-recognizes-bitcoin-as-private-money-sales-tax-coming-soon/,"['19 August 2013', '8 August 2017']",132,"After a parliamentary inquiry, Germany has clarified its position on Bitcoin. The federal ministry of finance recognized Bitcoins as “units of account” — the cryptocurrency is therefore be considered as “private money”. That’s why, according to Die Welt, the government stated that there wouldn’t be a tax exemption on commercial activities that use Bitcoins. In addition to paying capital gains tax, Bitcoin users should now pay sales tax (VAT) as well.

Member of Parliament Frank Schaeffler considers Bitcoin mining as private money creation, and says that the same fiscal and legal rules should apply to Euros and Bitcoins. Yet, it is still unclear how the sales tax will be implemented. For example, an individual who sells something on eBay every now and then doesn’t have to bother with sales tax. It should be the same with Bitcoin transactions.

Similarly, payment processors should be exempted from paying sales tax when dealing with German customers. They only act as intermediaries between a customer and a merchant. It remains to be confirmed whether commercial entities could avoid paying tax by opening a company abroad to bill its customers.

In other words, the federal ministry of finance is encouraging the same tax-optimization strategies used by Google, Apple, Amazon or Facebook in the European Union. As long as it remains an isolated initiative, Bitcoin companies will always find a way to avoid reporting its sales to German authorities.

Back in June, the German government stated that Bitcoin trading would be subject to capital gains tax, just like any other trading activity (25 percent plus solidarity surcharge and church tax). At the same time, Bitcoin users shouldn’t be taxed if they hold Bitcoins not to trade but to buy stuff. That’s why tax gains won’t be taxed if you hold your Bitcoins for more than a year.

As a reminder, last week, New York’s top banking regulator subpoenaed 22 Bitcoin firms to know whether they respect the current financial regulatory guidelines and to “root out illegal activity.”

When it comes to Bitcoin news, the German government’s decision is part of a bigger trend. Transactions and institutions will soon be regulated just like other financial institutions that deal with euros or dollars. While it legitimizes Bitcoin, it also confirms that the original purpose of Bitcoin could be lost along the way. Bitcoin is no longer an unregulated currency that works similarly in every country of the world. You now have to find a way to avoid tax, and authorities now have a say in what you are doing with your Bitcoins.

Bitcoin is a virtual currency that allows users to exchange online credits for goods and services. While there is no central bank that issues them, bitcoins can be created online by using a computer to complete difficult tasks, a process known as mining. Currently one bitcoin is worth just over $119.



Schaeffler said the new ruling showed German authorities were preparing regulations on how to tax bitcoin transactions. According to German newspaper Die Welt, the government has stated that the legal classification of bitcoin means that commercial profits that stem from using the currency may be taxable.



Kathleen Brooks, a research director at FOREX.com, told CNBC that classification by the German government gave bitcoin legitimacy to be used as a settlement currency in one of the world's largest economies. She said this was a big step forward for the bitcoin movement.

Gibraltar – 12 May 2021 – H.M Government of Gibraltar welcomes the news that BITSO, a leading Gibraltar licensed and regulated firm, has raised a $255 million Series C equity round led by Tiger Global and Coatue which, reports suggest, provides them with a US$2.2 billion valuation.

In 2019, BITSO obtained a full DLT license from the Gibraltar Financial Services Commission following the establishment of the DLT Legal framework which was introduced in January 2018. Gibraltar’s DLT legislation is the world’s first purpose-built regulatory framework for businesses using DLT to store or transfer value belonging to others.

The Hon Albert Isola, Minister for Digital and Financial Services said, “My sincere congratulations to our friends at BITSO for their continuing success. We are committed to providing an efficient, safe, and innovative regulatory framework for companies to be licensed and supervised here. As we continue to see the industry and companies like BITSO mature and push global boundaries, Gibraltar remains dedicated to creating an open dialogue between regulators and industry figures to promote this innovative business in a safe and regulated environment. As Gibraltar firms continue to grow internationally, we welcome their commitment to meeting these standards and demonstrating the effectiveness of our framework in the global marketplace.”

Daniel Vogel, CEO of BITSO commented, ""The GFSC and the DLT Providers Regulatory framework have allowed us to continue innovating, expanding and advocating for everybody in Latam to access this technology. It has been more than two years since we started planning our international expansion plans—obtaining our DLT license was an essential step on our way to expanding across the Region. Trust is paramount to make crypto useful and for our customers to use BITSO in their everyday life. The GFSC helps us establish that trust. This capital will enable us to expand our current capabilities, our product offering and continue making crypto useful across Latin America.""

BITSO's upcoming product offering will be focused on better serving the needs of consumers and businesses across Latin America by making crypto useful. New products are in development as BITSO continues to build next generation borderless financial services for consumers and businesses alike.

Having updated its DLT regulatory framework in late 2020, the Government of Gibraltar recently announced the establishment of a new working group that will be responsible for defining the appropriate market standards for VASP’s operating in the digital asset space.

On the flat lava plain of Reykjanesbaer, Iceland, near the Arctic Circle, you can find the mines of Bitcoin.

To get there, you pass through a fortified gate and enter a featureless yellow building. After checking in with a guard behind bulletproof glass, you face four more security checkpoints, including a so-called man trap that allows passage only after the door behind you has shut. This brings you to the center of the operation, a fluorescent-lit room with more than 100 whirring silver computers, each in a locked cabinet and each cooled by blasts of Arctic air shot up from vents in the floor.

These computers are the laborers of the virtual mines where Bitcoins are unearthed. Instead of swinging pickaxes, these custom-built machines, which are running an open-source Bitcoin program, perform complex algorithms 24 hours a day. If they come up with the right answers before competitors around the world do, they win a block of 25 new Bitcoins from the virtual currency’s decentralized network.

The network is programmed to release 21 million coins eventually. A little more than half are already out in the world, but because the system will release Bitcoins at a progressively slower rate, the work of mining could take more than 100 years.

The scarcity — along with a speculative mania that has grown up around digital money — has made each new Bitcoin worth as much as $1,100 in recent weeks.

Bitcoins are invisible money, backed by no government, useful only as a speculative investment or online currency, but creating them commands a surprisingly hefty real-world infrastructure.

“What we have here are money-printing machines,” said Emmanuel Abiodun, 31, founder of the company that built the Iceland installation, shouting above the din of the computers. “We cannot risk that anyone will get to them.”

Mr. Abiodun is one of a number of entrepreneurs who have rushed, gold-fever style, into large-scale Bitcoin mining operations in just the last few months. All of these people are making enormous bets that Bitcoin will not collapse, as it has threatened to do several times.

Just last week, moves by Chinese authorities caused the price of a Bitcoin to drop briefly below $500. If the system did crash, the new computers would be essentially useless because they are custom-built for Bitcoin mining.

Miners, though, are among the virtual-currency faithful, believing that Bitcoin will turn into a new, cheaper way of sending money around the world, leaving behind its current status as a largely speculative commodity.

Most of the new operations popping up guard their secrecy closely, but Mr. Abiodun agreed to show his installation for the first time. An earnest young Briton, with the casual fashion taste of the tech cognoscenti, he was a computer programmer at HSBC in London when he decided to invest in specialized computers that would carry out constant Bitcoin mining.

The computers that do the work eat up so much energy that electricity costs can be the deciding factor in profitability. There are Bitcoin mining installations in Hong Kong and Washington State, among other places, but Mr. Abiodun chose Iceland, where geothermal and hydroelectric energy are plentiful and cheap. And the arctic air is free and piped in to cool the machines, which often overheat when they are pushed to the outer limits of their computing capacity.

The operation can baffle even those entrusted with its care. Helgi Helgason, a burly, bald Icelandic man who oversees the data center that houses the machines, said that when he first heard that a Bitcoin mining operation was moving in he expected something very different. “I thought we’d bring in machines and put bags behind them and the coins would fall into them,” said Mr. Helgason, with a laugh.

Since then, the education he has received about Bitcoins has been enlightening, but only to a point.

“It’s a strange business,” he said, “and I can’t say that I understand it.”

Until just a few months ago, most Bitcoin mining was done on the home computers of digital-money fanatics. But as the value of a single Bitcoin skyrocketed over the last few months, the competition for new coins set off a race that quickly turned mining into an industrial enterprise.

“Even if you had hardware earlier this year, that is becoming obsolete,” said Greg Schvey, a co-founder of Genesis Block, a virtual-currency research firm. “You are talking about order-of-magnitude jumps.”

The work the computers do is akin to guessing at a lottery number. The faster the computers run, the better chance of guessing that right number and winning valuable coins. So mining entrepreneurs are buying chips and computers designed specifically — and only — for this work. The machines in Iceland are worth about $20,000 each on the open market.

The energy required to run these computers is huge, and has led to criticism that Bitcoin mining is wasteful, not to mention socially useless. But Mr. Abiodun prides himself on using renewable power, at least in Iceland.

When Mr. Abiodun first heard about Bitcoin mining in 2010, he thought it was a scam. Begun in 2009 as the imaginative creation of an anonymous programmer (or group of programmers) known as Satoshi Nakamoto, it was initially little more than a tech world curiosity. As early users connected their computers into the network, they became a part of the decentralized infrastructure that hosts Bitcoin’s open-source program. The computers joining the network immediately began capturing virtual coins. The network’s protocol was designed to release a new block of Bitcoins every 10 minutes until all 21 million were released, with the blocks getting smaller as time goes on. If the miners in the network take more than 10 minutes to guess the correct code, the Bitcoin program adapts to make the puzzle easier. If they solve the problems in less than 10 minutes, the code becomes harder.

Mr. Abiodun’s opinion of Bitcoin changed in January, when he saw the price rising. He installed a free application on his home computer that linked him into the Bitcoin network and set it to mining, harnessing the power of his graphics card, which is the part of a normal computer best suited to doing the code work.

Mr. Abiodun’s computer was in the guest room of his house in southeast London. Working at HSBC during the day and tinkering with his Bitcoin system at night, he realized if he wanted to make any money, his computer would have to run around the clock.

The constant computing, however, overheated the graphics card and pushed the computer’s exhaust fans into overdrive. When he added another graphics card, then a new computer, the room became too noisy for guests to sleep, and the windows had to be kept open to release the heat. That did not make his wife, Gloria, who was pregnant at the time, very happy.

“It just created a scenario where there was no way our parents would come over to stay,” he said. “I did offer to put her parents in a hotel, but that didn’t go down well.”

Mr. Abiodun’s wife finally gave him an ultimatum — either the computers had to go, or he did. At the same time, he was making money, and friends were asking if they could invest in his mining operation.

In February, Mr. Abiodun used the investors’ money to buy machines from a start-up dedicated solely to manufacturing specialized mining computers. The competition for those computers is so intense that he had to pay for them and wait for delivery.

When the delays became lengthy, however, he went on eBay and paid $130,000 for two high-powered machines, which he set up in June in a data center in Kansas City, Kan.

This was the beginning of Mr. Abiodun’s company, Cloud Hashing, which rents out computing power to people who want to mine without buying computers themselves. The term hashing refers to the repetitive code guessing that miners do.

Today, all of the machines dedicated to mining Bitcoin have a computing power about 4,500 times the capacity of the United States government’s mightiest supercomputer, the IBM Sequoia, according to calculations done by Michael B. Taylor, a professor at the University of California, San Diego. The computing capacity of the Bitcoin network has grown by around 30,000 percent since the beginning of the year.

“This whole new kind of machine has come into existence in the last 12 months,” said Professor Taylor, who is studying mining hardware. In the chase for the lucky code that will unlock new Bitcoins, mining computers are also verifying and assigning unique identifying tags to each Bitcoin transaction, acting as accountants for the virtual currency world.

“The network is providing the infrastructure for making sure the currency is being transferred between people according to the rules,” Professor Taylor said, “and making sure people aren’t creating currency illegally.”

Even before Mr. Abiodun’s machines in Kansas City were up and running, it was clear that they wouldn’t be enough. So he ordered about 100 machines from a start-up in Sweden and, in October, had them moved to the facility in Iceland. In just a few months, that installation has generated more than $4 million worth of Bitcoins, at the current value, according to the company’s account on the public Bitcoin network.

At the end of each day, the spoils are divided up and sent to Cloud Hashing’s customers. Last Wednesday, for example, the entire operation unlocked 225 Bitcoins, valued at around $160,000 at recent prices. Cloud Hashing keeps about 20 percent of the capacity for its own mining.

The unregulated Bitcoin-mining industry is ripe for abuse, and ventures that sound similar to Cloud Hashing have turned out to be scams. Mr. Abiodun’s company has proved itself real, but it is still unclear if it is a good deal for customers. Cloud Hashing charges $999 to rent a tiny portion of the company’s computing power for one year. That’s an expensive price for the computing capacity they are getting, but Mr. Abiodun argues that it’s a good value because individual miners would not be able to buy his modern machines outright. It’s a little like buying a fractional ownership in a private jet; you might not want responsibility for the jet itself, and it’s out of your price range anyway. He also says he provides the maintenance and keeps away thieves and hackers.

Some Cloud Hashing customers have also complained on Internet forums that it can be hard to get a response from the company when something goes wrong. But this has not stopped new contracts from pouring in. Cloud Hashing now has 4,500 customers, up from 1,000 in September.

Mr. Abiodun acknowledges that the company has not been prepared to deal with its rapid growth. He said he had used $4 million raised from two angel investors to add customer service representatives to offices in Austin, Tex., and London. Cloud Hashing is now preparing to open a mining facility in a data center near Dallas, which will hold more than $3 million worth of new machines being produced by CoinTerra, a Texas start-up run by a former Samsung chip designer.

The higher energy costs — and required air-conditioning — in Texas are worth it for Mr. Abiodun. He wants his operation to be widely distributed in case of power shortages or regulatory issues in one location. But he is also expanding his Icelandic operation, shipping in about 66 machines that have been running for the last few months near their manufacturer in Ukraine.

Mr. Abiodun said that by February, he hopes to have about 15 percent of the entire computing power of the Bitcoin network, significantly more than any other operation.

Inside the Iceland data center, which also hosts servers for large companies like BMW and is guarded and maintained by a company called Verne Global, strapping Icelandic men in black outfits were at work recently setting up the racks for the machines coming from Ukraine. Gazing over his creation, Mr. Abiodun had a look that was somewhere between pride and anxiety, and spoke about the virtues of this Icelandic facility where the power has not gone down once.

“We don’t want downtime — ever, never,” he said. “Not with what we paid. Not with Bitcoin.”",Translation Unavailable,0,"[('virtual', 0.04537402), ('financial', 0.028159728), ('risk', 0.027705299), ('european', 0.022151865), ('legal', 0.022136075), ('issued', 0.022047507), ('authority', 0.018713262), ('3', 0.018013643), ('central', 0.017341798), ('trading', 0.015194941)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

The upcoming Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 is different from the earlier one – ‘Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019.’

While the older law sought to impose a complete ban on all crypto-related activities including mining, buying, holding, selling, and dealing, the new one will look to make a clear distinction when it comes to its often used categorisation as a currency.

Currently, there is no regulation or any ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. The Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) order banning banks from supporting crypto transactions, was reversed by the Supreme Court order of March 2020.

The Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021 is listed for introduction in Parliament’s Winter Session seeks to prohibit all “private cryptocurrencies” in India. However, it allows for certain exceptions to promote the underlying technology of cryptocurrency and its uses.

In 2013, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a circular warning the public against the use of virtual currencies. The bank warned users, holders, and traders of virtual currencies about the potential financial, operational, legal, customer protection, and security-related risks they are exposing themselves to.

The central bank pointed out that it has been keeping a close eye on developments in the virtual currency world, including Bitcoins, Litecoins, and other altcoins.

But as banks continued to allow transactions on cryptocurrency exchanges — on February 1, 2017, RBI released another circular, reiterating its concerns with virtual coins. And by the end of 2017, a warning was issued by RBI and the finance ministry clarifying that virtual currencies are not a legal tender.

At the same time, two Public Interest Litigations (PILs) were filed in the Supreme Court, one asking for a ban on buying and selling of cryptocurrencies in India, the other asking for them to be regulated. In November, the government formed a committee to study issues around virtual currencies and propose actions.

At this time, there was no ban on cryptocurrencies and most banks allowed transactions from cryptocurrency exchanges.

In March 2018, the Central Board of Digital Tax (CBDT) submitted a draft scheme to the finance ministry for banning virtual currencies. A month later, the RBI issued a circular that restrained banks and financial institutions from providing financial services to virtual currency exchanges.

Former RBI deputy governor BP Kanungo and then Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) chairman Sushil Chandra voiced their opinions in favour of a ban on cryptocurrencies. Chandra said it creates “a chain of black money.” He also mentioned that searches conducted into exchanges dealing with virtual currencies had revealed that most uninformed people in interior places are being lured to buy it.

On April 6, 2018, RBI issues a circular asking commercial and co-operative banks, payments banks, small finance banks, NBFCs, and payment system providers from dealing in virtual currencies, or providing services to all entities which deal with crypto exchanges.

Cryptocurrency prices fell, exchanges froze, and withdrawals stopped once that order was passed.

In April 2018, the finance ministry appointed-committee proposed a draft bill for the regulation of virtual currencies but did not recommend a ban. However, in February 2019 the committee proposed a fresh draft bill that recommended a blanket ban.

Meanwhile, in March 2020 a significant development took place. The Supreme Court of India lifted the curb on cryptocurrency imposed by RBI, which restricted banks and financial institutions from providing access to banking services to those engaged in transactions in crypto assets.

“A high-level Inter-Ministerial Committee (IMC) constituted under the Chairmanship of Secretary (Economic Affairs) to study the issues related to virtual currencies and propose specific actions to be taken in the matter recommended in its report that all private cryptocurrencies, except any virtual currencies issued by the state, will be prohibited in India,” Finance Minister Sitharaman said in Rajya Sabha on February 9.

Minister of State for Finance Anurag Thakur also informed Parliament that the government planned to bring a Bill on cryptocurrencies as the existing laws were deemed inadequate to deal with the issues concerning cryptocurrencies.

Further, a report revealed that India could propose a law banning cryptocurrencies, fining anyone trading in the country or even holding such digital assets, a senior government official told Reuters at the time.

Days after the report surfaced, in an interview on March 5, Sitharaman said she wants to foster innovation in crypto. “We want to make sure that there is a window available for all kinds of experiments which will have to take place in the crypto world,” she said during an interview on CNBC TV18. “We are not closing our minds.”

Further, in November 2021, the Standing Committee on Finance, chaired by BJP member Jayant Sinha, met representatives of crypto exchanges, Blockchain and Crypto Assets Council (BACC), among others, and came to the conclusion that cryptocurrencies should not be banned, but regulated.

Earlier this month, Prime Minister Narendra Modi called a meeting on cryptocurrencies with senior officials. The indications are that strong regulatory steps will probably be taken to deal with the issue.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India has repeatedly underlined its strong view against cryptocurrencies, saying these pose a serious threat to the macroeconomic and financial stability of the country. It has also raised doubts on the number of investors trading on cryptocurrencies and their claimed market value.

RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das reiterated his opposition to cryptocurrencies, saying these pose a serious threat to any financial system since they are unregulated by central banks. The RBI announced its intent to come out with an official digital currency in the face of the proliferation of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, about which the central bank has had many concerns.

Sitharaman Tuesday termed cryptocurrency as a “risky area” while speaking in the Rajya Sabha. She said that they are yet to take a call on advertisements around cryptocurrency. The statement comes a day after she was quoted as saying in the Lok Sabha that there was no proposal to recognise Bitcoin as a currency in the country.

“This is a risky area and not in a complete regulatory framework. No decision was taken on banning its advertisements. Steps are taken to create awareness through RBI and SEBI. The government will soon introduce a Bill,” Sitharaman said during the Question Hour in Rajya Sabha.

India is preparing to clamp down on its booming cryptocurrency trade with a new law likely to be introduced in parliament this month.

Details of the legislation remain unclear, but the government wants to ban all private digital currencies, with some exceptions.

India hopes that a ban would pave the way for the Reserve Bank of India — the country's central bank — to gain control over digital money, despite concerns over the lack of advanced data protection laws.

The central bank has repeatedly warned cryptocurrency could pose ""serious concerns on macroeconomic and financial stability,"" while Prime Minister Narendra Modi in November said cryptocurrencies could ""spoil our youth.""

The government has also warned that unregulated crypto markets could become avenues for money laundering, fraud and terror financing.

At least eight cases of cryptocurrency-related frauds are under investigation by the Directorate of Enforcement, India's agency tasked with fighting financial crime.

But despite warnings from the government and details of the planned bill still in the shadows, many cryptocurrency investors are hoping they will still be able to trade.

""Even if there are restrictions imposed by the government, I hold multiple trading accounts in domestic, as well as foreign exchanges,"" Pritha Sengupta, a 25-year-old entrepreneur, told DW.

""Some of my trades have resulted in very attractive returns... almost over 500 times and bank deposits hardly give us less than 7% in a year,"" Pritha added.

Also unfazed by government warnings, graduate Manisha Singh insists the crypto market is a ""great way to build up wealth"" in India.

""The best part is that it helps us invest in small amounts. I have sold bitcoins at a profit,"" Singh told DW.

India's crypto boom

India has become one of the biggest markets in Asia for cryptocurrencies and one of the fastest growing in the world. The country has 15 homegrown cryptocurrency exchange platforms.

Between 15 and 20 million people in India are estimated to own cryptocurrencies, with holdings totaling approximately $6 billion (€5.31 billion), industry figures indicate.

The market for cryptocurrency and blockchain technology has surged significantly in recent years, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns, when much of the country's population was forced to stay at home.

The local crypto market exploded when the Supreme Court overturned a previous ban last year, growing 641% between July 2020 and June 2021, according to cryptocurrency research firm Chainalysis.

Bitcoin saw an average return on investment of 66% in November and — along with cryptocurrencies Mana, Dogecoin and Ethereum — traded the most in volume during the festive season of Diwali in early November.

Film and cricket stars have also endorsed homegrown crypto exchanges by fronting advertising campaigns for platforms like CoinSwitch Kuber and CoinDCX, both of which have upped their social media campaigns.

Indians are set to invest more than $10 billion in the cryptocurrency market by 2030, according to a report by trade association Nasscom.

But when speculation around the proposed cryptocurrency legislation began last month, prices of some of the most popular digital currencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Tether nosedived by as much as 25% — momentarily.

Calls for regulatory framework

Lekha Chakraborty, professor at the National Institute of Public Finance and Policy, maintains that cryptocurrency plays an important role in a globalized, post-pandemic world.

""I am not worried about the political economy of crypto, because those can be tackled through efficient monetary and fiscal coordination. However, the concern is about the regulatory framework, which needs to be strengthened, especially in the cross-border transactions,"" Chakraborty told DW.

""Fear of crypto is overplayed. There is no retreat of globalization in the post-pandemic world. In a globalized world, digital currency can ease the transactions,"" she said.

Crypto bill hangs in the balance

A proposed clause in the new law, which is still being debated, would allow for the possession of cryptocurrency as an asset and ban its use as currency or payment.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said the new law was being reworked to take into account the rapid changes in the industry, without offering details of the changes to the original draft.

Speculation continues to abound about whether the law will prohibit cyptocurrencies or merely attempt to regulate them.

""Even keeping crypto as an asset is so speculative and volatile at this point, that it could dangerously see-saw the asset ownership landscape and impact the real economy,"" economist Indira Rajaraman told DW.

By Aneesha Mathur: The Supreme Court on Wednesday quashed an order by the Reserve bank of India (RBI) banning financial services firms from trading in virtual currency or cryptocurrency.

Its decision comes after hearing several petitions challenging RBI's April 2018 order imposing a ban on financial firms or individuals in India from trading in cryptocurrencies.

The development comes almost two years after trading in virtual currency was banned by RBI. While the order revoked the ban on illegal cryptocurrency trade, it is worth noting that the government already prepared a draft bill that seeks to prohibit mining, holding, selling, trade, issuance, disposal or use of cryptocurrency in the country.

It is worth mentioning that under the draft bill, all the aforementioned activities can be punished with a fine or imprisonment up to 10 years, or both in some cases.

The draft bill was prepared by a government panel which also called for the launch of an official government-backed digital currency in India to function like banknotes, to be issued through the Reserve Bank of India (RBI).

Meanwhile, there continues to be global uncertainty on virtual currency trade, especially with regulatory issues.

The Indian government has issued repeated warnings against investing in digital currencies, saying these were like Ponzi schemes that offer unusually high returns to early investors.

The government panel, headed by the then finance secretary Subhash Chandra Garg, recommended a fine of up to 250 million rupees ($3.63 million) and imprisonment for up to 10 years for anyone who mines, generates, holds, sells, transfers or issues cryptocurrency.

There is no underlying intrinsic value of these private cryptocurrencies, the panel said in its report submitted to the finance ministry.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on May 31 asked banks not to cite its 2018 order as a reason to deny banking services to customers who dealt in cryptocurrencies. It stated that its 2018 order was set aside by the Supreme Court in March this year and that it would be inappropriate for banks to cite the order any longer.

However, the central bank asked banks to continue other due diligence procedures on cryptocurrency traders under rules linked to anti-money laundering and prevention of terrorism.

What did the RBI’s 2018 circular say?

In April 2018, the RBI issued a circular instructing banks to make sure customers dealing in cryptocurrencies were not allowed access to banking services. The circular came after years of suspicion among RBI officials about the legitimacy of virtual currencies issued by private parties.

The central bank has repeatedly warned about the supposed risks that these unregulated private currencies pose to investors and the financial system. The 2018 circular was seen by many as an attempt to discourage citizens from purchasing cryptocurrencies. By barring banks from facilitating transactions involving cryptocurrencies, the RBI effectively banned any significant rupee investment in cryptocurrencies.

Why did the SC overturn the RBI’s 2018 order to banks?

The Supreme Court in its judgment on Internet and Mobile Association of India vs. RBI in March overturned the RBI’s 2018 circular. The SC noted that in the absence of any legislative ban on the buying or selling of cryptocurrencies, the RBI cannot impose disproportionate restrictions on trading in these currencies. The court felt such restrictions would interfere with the fundamental right of citizens to carry out any trade that is deemed legitimate under the law.

Is this a stamp of approval for cryptocurrencies from the RBI and the Supreme Court?

No. The SC, while overturning the RBI order, simply stated that there is no legal basis at the moment to impose heavy restrictions on cryptocurrencies. The court may not hold this view in the future once a law is passed in Parliament banning the use of cryptocurrencies. The RBI, on the other hand, may have been compelled to issue the current clarification simply because certain banks recently cited its 2018 circular (which is now void) to stop customers from dealing in cryptocurrencies.

Banks have been reluctant to let their customers deal in cryptocurrencies due to the uncertainty surrounding the legality. Meanwhile, the Centre is considering a proposal to impose an outright ban on cryptocurrencies. In 2017, it is worth noting, an inter-disciplinary committee set up by the Centre had recommended a ban on the trading and possession of cryptocurrencies.

What is the future of cryptocurrencies in India?

Cryptocurrency sceptics say there is good reason to believe that governments around the world will eventually ban all cryptocurrencies. They argue that governments and their central banks will not allow the dilution of their monopoly power over money.

The Indian government has been giving conflicting signals on this matter. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman in March said that there won’t be a total ban on the use of cryptocurrencies in the country. But the Centre soon plans to introduce the Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2021, which is said to contain provisions completely banning the use of all cryptocurrencies. The future of cryptocurrencies in India, thus, still hangs in the balance.","June 02, 2021 10:30 am | Updated June 03, 2021 12:48 pm IST

The so-called concerns over cryptocurrency are misplaced at best and smack of the central bank’s statist approach at worst.

On March 4, 2020, a three-judge bench of the Supreme Court had quashed the ban that the RBI had imposed on trading in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin in April 2018.

On May 31 this year, the RBI had directed banks not to cite its 2018 ban as a reason to deny banking services to customers dealing in cryptocurrency. “It has come to our attention through media reports that certain banks/regulated entities have cautioned their customers against dealing in virtual currencies” by making a reference to the ban it had imposed, an RBI circular said.

So, it took almost a year for the RBI to realize, and that too from media reports, that the entities regulated by it still regarded virtual currencies as proscribed. This is surely not a mark of the banking regulator’s efficiency.

Counterview: Why Cryptocurrency is a Kardashian, Not Meryl Streep

It directed the banks that following the apex court order, the earlier circular proscribing virtual currencies was no longer valid. The circular went on to add, “Banks, as well as other entities addressed above, may, however, continue to carry out customer due diligence processes in line with regulations governing standards for Know Your Customer (KYC), Anti-Money Laundering (AML), Combating of Financing of Terrorism (CFT) and obligations of regulated entities under Prevention of Money Laundering Act, (PMLA), 2002, in addition to ensuring compliance with relevant provisions under Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA) for overseas remittances.”

Banks continued to caution their customers against dealing in cryptocurrencies because the RBI, despite the SC verdict, has persistently campaigned against the innovation. In the last week of February this year, Das raised concerns over VCs. The next month he again said the RBI had major concerns. Then again in June. His opposition to cryptocurrency seems to be the zeal of an activist rather than the reservation of a statutory regulator regarding an issue.

So, the RBI remains hostile towards and suspicious of cryptocurrencies, which are digitally encrypted, decentralized, and not regulated by any central bank or government. Right from the beginning of cryptocurrencies in the 1980s, its votaries were anti-establishment activists whose distrust of central banks as well as governments was libertarian-like.

As one of them, Adam Back, wrote: “What we want is fully anonymous, ultra-low transaction cost, transferable units of exchange. If we get that going … the banks will become the obsolete dinosaurs they deserve to become.”

The parent of the first successful cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, is a mysterious, unknown figure by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. He is said to have sent an e-mail in August 2008 to Adam Back, along with an attachment, a white paper.

According to Satoshi, “The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work. The central bank must be trusted not to debase the currency but the history of fiat currencies is full of breaches of that trust.”

He and other cryptocurrency enthusiasts overcame the problem by bypassing all central banks and governments. Bitcoin was born and became hugely successful, attracting billions of dollars in the last few years.

Yet, as evident from Das’ recent salvo at virtual currencies, the central bank is unwilling to accept this development. This does not show him and the RBI in a good light; the central bank starts looking like a Luddite, instinctively hostile to innovation. And like a control freak that can’t accept anything it can’t control (the government’s approach was similar to that of the RBI. It once planned a law to ban VCs). This is not much different from the Chinese attitude. It may be noted that China proscribes VCs.

On the other hand, many major democracies, such as the US, Canada and the UK, allow the use of Bitcoin. Even the tiny Latin American nation El Salvador with a population of 6.5 million, recently accepted Bitcoin as legal tender.

It is not that the RBI has nothing important to do. “Gross non-performing assets (GNPAs) on retail and MSME loan books of public sector banks rose to 7.28 per cent in June 2021 from about 6 per cent a year ago. The incidence of bad loans was lower for private banks with GNPAs at 3.32 per cent in June, up from 2.01 per cent year ago, according to CARE Ratings,” says a Business Standard report.

Another report in The Indian Express says, “Public sector banks are experiencing a sharp surge in the proportion of Mudra loans turning into non-performing assets (NPAs) following the impact of COVID on incomes and repayment capacity of borrowers, according to bankers and an analysis of available data from state-level bankers’ committees.”

These developments are not surprising, given the devastation the coronavirus has occasioned.

Then there is the issue of bank privatization, something urgently needed but, if it happens, will be hugely controversial. The good news is that Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has made her government’s intentions clear over the subject. A couple of weeks ago, she said, “During the budget, a public enterprise policy was announced, wherein we had identified certain strategically important sectors and in them, the bare minimum presence of the government will be there. Banks, financial institutions, and insurance are identified as strategic sectors, which means the government’s minimum presence will be there in insurance.”

It would be worth its while if the RBI works in tandem with the government to smoothen the process of bank privatization.

Then there is a great deal that India has to do in the realm of financial inclusion. The recently unveiled RBI’s annual Financial Inclusion (FI) Index shows the country at 53.9, where 100 is the full financial inclusion score.

The RBI should focus on such urgent matters instead of crying like a bad loser on the issue of cryptocurrency.

2021 was a year full of buzz around cryptocurrency in India, apps coming up with private cryptocurrency(bitcoin), people investing in bitcoins, government twice was close to come up with a law banning all private cryptocurrency, but no material step was taken in this area. It becomes imperative to understand all about cryptocurrency and the article aims to give a detailed analysis on cryptocurrency, its challenges and the way forward.

What is cryptocurrency?

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange similar to a Rupee or any other currency. The difference is while a rupee or a dollar exists in a physical form which is a printed note, cryptocurrency is held in an electronic form based on a technology named blockchain. Blockchain is nothing but a decentralized ledger in an electronic form which contains “blocks” in other words transactions across a peer-to-peer network, which means without an involvement of a third party.

Bitcoin is the world’s best known cryptocurrency which is considered to be the largest in terms of market value followed by Ethereum. If we talk about how cryptocurrency works, it needs to be understood in the context of a fiat money (currency with authorized permission and regulation), for example a rupee is regulated by the Reserve Bank of India which ensures that the money in circulation is genuine and is recorded. In the context of a cryptocurrency, a chain of private computers execute this process and solve complex cryptographic puzzles, this is done to authenticate the transaction, this process is called mining.

TRADING IN CRYPTOCURRENCIES

To trade in cryptocurrency, one needs to first buy a cryptocurrency, there are two ways in which a cryptocurrency can be brought, firstly, you can buy crypto coin from someone and the second, is to mine your own cryptocurrency. Buying happens in either an exchange facilitated transaction or a peer-to-peer transaction. Talking in the context of India, the simplest way to trade in cryptocurrency is through one of the exchange and trading platforms which includes, WazirX, CoinDCX, CoinSwitch Kuber etc.

To trade in cryptocurrency by using INR, the user needs to register on one of the exchange platforms mentioned above, and complete a KYC process, then if the user is buying cryptocurrency for the very first time will need to load INR money in their wallet of their cryptocurrency exchange.

FRAMEWORK ACROSS COUNTRIES & INDIA

El Salvador has become the first country to recognize bitcoin as a legal tender, China on the other hand has imposed a complete ban on cryptocurrency. It becomes imperative to look at some of the other jurisdictions around the world and their regulatory framework regarding cryptocurrency.

In the United States, The federal government does not recognize cryptocurrency as a legal tender, the two major regulators i.e. US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) are playing catch up while regulating the digital currency market, their objectives are two fold, firstly, protecting the investing public and secondly, maintaining market stability.

In the United Kingdom, Her Majesty’s Revenue and customs department has not considered crypto assets as a currency. Furthermore, it has noted that cryptocurrency does not qualify to be any form of investment activity.

In Canada its regulator, Canada Revenue Authority (CRA) though does not recognize it as a fiat currency but treats it like a commodity used for payment and investment purposes and the same is subject to taxation.

Israel through its legislation, Supervision of Financial Services Law includes digital currency within the definition of financial assets. The Israel tax Authority demands 25% on profits made through exchange and trading of cryptocurrency.

India though has not come up with any policy or legislation either regulating or banning cryptocurrency, however, before the winter session of parliament last year there were conjectures that the government may come up with a law banning all private cryptocurrencies, but nothing concrete happened, which has led to uncertainty amongst investors in the Indian crypto market. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) though, has given some hints as to what would a regulatory framework on cryptocurrency in India look like.

The RBI is expected to come up with Central Bank Digital Currency (CBDC) a digital currency that can be transacted using platforms based on blockchains and would be regulated by RBI. However, this is just a form of digital currency, but the broader question is what should be a comprehensive policy related to cryptocurrency? Mr. Hemant Batra a renowned public policy expert and a lawyer while speaking to Mumbai Uncensored has provided his detailed insight and expertise on the policy regarding cryptocurrency, he says, “public policy can be of two types, firstly, a policy which brings or initiates a reform in any sector or segment within the society and second, is a policy brought about to formalize a change which has already happened. The Indian cryptocurrency market has now become very big with involvement of billions of dollars in the market hence, it is now unattainable and irreconcilable for the government to completely ban all sorts of cryptocurrency and its trading and investment. India is absolutely ready to accept cryptocurrency with a regulatory system based on global requirements as per the guidelines issued by IMF (International Monetary Fund). Banning cryptocurrency will lead to damaging the financial statistics of all nations”

CONCERNS AROUND CRYPTOCURRENCY

The next aspect is the challenges that cryptocurrency puts forth before the policy makers, these can be termed as “macro” consequence of cryptocurrency. First aspect is the challenge related to the monetary policy, former RBI governor Duvvuri Subbarao speaking at a public forum has expressed his concerns on cryptocurrency and its impact on monetary policy according to him, cryptocurrency may erode central bank’s control over money supply, “Crypto is backed by algorithms and there is fear that the central bank might lose control over money supply and inflation management. There are also concerns that crypto will disrupt the monetary policy,” he said, “Crypto can jump capital controls; fiat money is linked to the reserve currency,” his indication was towards “stablecoins” whose value is tied to a fiat currency by maintaining equivalent reserves (“currency board” exchange rate regime).

The next challenge is fiscal, that is cryptocurrency being used as a tool for tax evasion as it would be very feasible for a crypto investor to invest his untaxed money in purchasing bitcoins and similar would be a case in money laundering wherein “proceeds of crime” could easily be invested in any of the cryptocurrency exchange and trading platforms. Mr. Batra on this point states, “FATF (Financial Action task force) and IMF have expressed their serious concern about this issue, there are certain sets of cryptocurrency that are based on very private blockchains wherein one cannot identify the nation from which such virtual currency is operating and there are cases investigated globally wherein there has been a direct link between financing illegal and terror activities through crypto exchanges. To tackle this scenario, the government has to introduce regulatory regimes not on the cryptocurrency but crypto service providers.”

On the point of cryptocurrency being a very lucrative investment avenue Mr. Batra says, “investment in government bonds and securities, SEBI controlled mutual funds, financial securities might take a hit as people will not take risk in investing smaller companies and thus, they will either invest in blue chip companies or in cryptos”. Thus, cryptocurrency in India has now become a major factor in the financial as well as the economic realm and now what is needed is a comprehensive regulatory framework which ensures investor protection as well as market stability of crypto. In the budget session scheduled to start from 30th January; the Union Budget will be presented on February 1st, the government is expected to come up with a law on cryptocurrency, it would be very interesting to see how the law is formulated.",Translation Unavailable,0,"[('virtual', 0.04537402), ('financial', 0.028159728), ('risk', 0.027705299), ('european', 0.022151865), ('legal', 0.022136075), ('issued', 0.022047507), ('authority', 0.018713262), ('3', 0.018013643), ('central', 0.017341798), ('trading', 0.015194941)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

For instance, there is a no central authority to regulate, take ownership or provide security to safeguard crypto assets.

There is ease of use and making transactions on a real-time basis, with no cross-border restrictions. Anonymity is offered, but there is virtually no know-your-customer (KYC) requirement, which makes it a concern from a traceability point of view. One of the major issues is that crypto accounts can be used for illicit purposes that are impossible to track. This makes it worrisome. Creating a crypto wallet requires just an internet-enabled device. With limited information technology literacy, this can expose users to high-risk situations and make them potential targets for cyber criminals. The resurrection of cryptocurrencies will depend on how the ecosystem can grow while mitigating risks.

We need to initiate dialogue with the Indian policymakers and regulators and work towards creating a crypto regulatory framework in India. Recently, South Korea legalised crypto. Japan and Australia have a positive outlook towards crypto as well. More and more countries are setting up regulation for crypto now. Regulating crypto will be a huge win for India as it will lead to more blockchain-focused startups, more jobs, and more tax revenue for the government.

Crypto is a new-age asset class; we shouldn’t pit it against fiat currencies. Currency is just one of the many possible use-cases of crypto. Moreover, the financial action task force (FATF) guidelines clearly states that crypto is not a threat to the global economy, and can be regulated properly. FATF has, in fact, even submitted a crypto standard regulation report to G20 countries, and India is a G20 member. Both crypto and fiat can co-exist and, in fact, crypto can help banks solve the existing problems for millions of unbanked people.

Due to the note ban, Indians had to use peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms for transactions, but the banking channel will be even more successful as it's more convenient for users. It will make it very easy for Indians to start trading in crypto.

Cryptocurrencies will serve as a foundational layer for a new wave of global financial services that empowers end-users to effectively be their own banks.

We've long believed that India will be one of the leading countries for cryptocurrency and digital asset adoption as a natural progression toward a cashless Indian economy. The Supreme Court's decision to support innovation by legalising bitcoin and cryptocurrency trading is a major step in the right direction for both India's consumers and crypto businesses that want to serve them.

Not only will this decision expand the daily use of cryptocurrencies in India, it will also attract new talent and innovation that will support the country’s own blockchain and distributed ledger technology initiatives. Cryptocurrency is a digital currency that runs on blockchain technology.

Countries that embrace public cryptocurrencies will attract talent and generate domestic technology advantages that will help them win the blockchain technology race. A recent example of this occurred in China, which partially relaxed regulations around cryptocurrency mining following President Xi’s speech announcing blockchain technology as a national priority.

India has developed a strong position in developing next-generation blockchain and distributed ledger technologies, and this infusion of talent and enhanced regulatory clarity will only help Indian firms develop regional and global leadership positions.","On March 4, the Supreme Court lifted the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) ban on cryptocurrency transactions.

The court states that there are three important aspects to the case:

That the RBI has not so far found, in the past five years or more, the activities of virtual currency (VC) exchanges to have actually impacted adversely, the way the entities regulated by RBI function. The stand taken by RBI is that the central bank has NOT prohibited VCs in the country. The Inter-Ministerial Committee constituted in November 2017 initially recommended a specific legal framework including the introduction of a new law namely, Crypto-token Regulation Bill 2018. The panel was of the opinion that a ban might be an extreme tool and that the same objectives can be achieved through regulatory measures.

The court says that as on date VCs are not banned, but the trading in VCs and the functioning of VC exchanges have been sent to comatose by the impugned circular by disconnecting their lifeline namely, the interface with the regular banking sector.

“The government does not recognise cryptocurrency as legal tender or coin and will take all measures to eliminate the use of these cryptoassets in financing illegitimate activities or as part of the payments system,” Jaitley said.

This declaration comes after months of speculation over the fate of cryptocurrencies in India, home to a large number of bitcoin traders and investors. In fact, one in every 10 bitcoin transactions in the world takes place in India.

“The government will now either come out with a legislative mechanism or make suitable amendment in existing legislation to ensure that dealing and trading in cryptocurrency is made illegal and to penalise entities and individuals who are involved in their trade and circulation,” said Monish Panda, founder of Monish Panda & Associates law firm. “We will have to wait and watch as to what will be the final framework of such legislation.”

Over the last few months, the government and the Reserve Bank of India have repeatedly expressed their discomfort over bitcoin and other e-currencies. Late last year, the finance ministry dubbed them a ponzi scheme. “There is a real and heightened risk of investment bubble of the type seen in ponzi schemes which can result in sudden and prolonged crash exposing investors, especially retail consumers losing their hard-earned money,” the ministry had said. “Consumers need to be alert and extremely cautious to avoid getting trapped in such ponzi schemes.”

Aset kripto dinilai memiliki gharar, dharar, dan bertentangan dengan aturan yang sudah berlaku mengenai alat bayar di Indonesia. Maka dari itu aset kripto diharamkan untuk digunakan sebagai alat bayar.

""Penggunaan cryptocurrency sebagai mata uang hukumnya haram karena gharar, dharar, dan bertentangan dengan Undang-undang Nomor 7 Tahun 2011 dan peraturan BI nomor 17 tahun 2015 ketika dimaknai sebagai mata uang,"" ujar Ketua MUI Bidang Fatwa Asrorun Niam Soleh dalam keterangan pers virtual, Kamis (11/11/2021).

Kemudian dalam diktum yang kedua aset kripto sebagai komoditas atau aset digital diputuskan tidak sah untuk diperjualbelikan. Aset kripto dinilai mengandung gharar, dharar, dan qimar.

Aset kripto juga tidak memenuhi syarat sil'ah secara syar'i. Syarat yang dimaksud adalah memiliki wujud fisik, memiliki nilai, diketahui jumlah secara pasti, bisa dijadikan hak milik, dan bsia diserahkan ke pembeli.

Diktum yang ketiga diputuskan bahwa aset kripto sebagai komoditi atau aset yang memiliki landasan jelas atau underlying assetnya hukumnya boleh digunakan.

""Yang ketiga, cryptocurrency sebagai komoditi atau aset yang berbasis kepada underlying dan manfaat yang jelas hukumnya masih diperbolehkan,"" ungkapnya.

Crypto's law was made in three dictums in the Ijtima Ulama decision.The first dictum of crypto money is considered haram used as a currency.

Crypto assets are considered to have gharar, dharar, and contrary to the rules that have applied regarding payment tools in Indonesia.Therefore crypto assets are forbidden to be used as a means of payment.

""The use of cryptocurrency as a legal currency is haram because of gharar, dharar, and is contrary to Law Number 7 of 2011 and BI Regulation Number 17 of 2015 when interpreted as currency,"" said Chairman of the MUI in the field of Fatwa Asrorun Niam Soleh in a virtual press statement,Thursday (11/11/2021).

Then in the second dictum of crypto assets as commodities or digital assets it is decided to be invalid for sale.Crypto assets are considered to contain gharar, dharar, and qimar.

Crypto assets also do not meet the requirements of syar'i.The requirement in question is to have a physical form, has a value, known to the exact amount, can be used as property rights, and can be submitted to the buyer.

The third dictum is decided that crypto assets as commodities or assets that have a clear foundation or underlying assets can be used.

""The third, cryptocurrency as a commodity or asset based on underlying and clear benefits is still permitted,"" he said.

UU PPSK ini merupakan UU sapu jagat di sektor keuangan, terutama dalam menghadapi krisis dan beradaptasi dengan perkembangan teknologi.

Terdiri dari 27 bab dan 341 pasal, UU PPSK mengubah 17 UU di sektor keuangan. Ini mencakup UU tentang Bank Indonesia (BI), Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), Lembaga Penjaminan Simpanan (LPS), Perbankan, Perbankan Syariah, Perasuransian, Pasar Modal, Perdagangan Berjangka Komoditi, Surat Utang Negara (SUN), Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional (SJSN), Lembaga Pembiayaan Ekspor Indonesia (LPEI), dan Pencegahan dan Penanganan Krisis Sistem Keuangan.

Anggota DPR dari Fraksi PDIP Dolfie Othniel Frederic Palit mengatakan, proses pembahasan UU ini sudah dilakukan sejak November 2021. Revisi sejumlah UU dilakukan setelah melihat otoritas di sektor keuangan memiliki gerak terbatas untuk mengantisipasi dampak ekonomi dari pandemi Covid-19.

Di sisi lain, konsumen dan bisnis telah mengadopsi teknologi keuangan dengan cepat, seperti aset kripto.

Sebagian perubahan-perubahan besar dalam UU PPSK berkaitan dengan respons terhadap krisis dan perkembangan teknologi di sektor jasa keuangan.

Antisipasi Krisis

Salah satu poin perubahan dalam UU PPSK adalah peran Bank Indonesia. Dalam UU ini mandat BI ditambah untuk ikut “mendukung pertumbuhan ekonomi yang berkelanjutan.” Sebelumnya, dalam UU Nomor 23 tahun 1999 yang kemudian diubah menjadi UU Nomor 4 tahun 2003, BI memiliki tujuan tunggal, yaitu “mencapai dan memelihara kestabilan nilai rupiah.”

Secara eksplisit UU PPSK menugaskan BI untuk “menetapkan dan melaksanakan kebijakan makroprudensial.” Perubahan ini berkaitan dengan peran BI selama pandemi Covid-19 dalam mendorong pemulihan dan pertumbuhan ekonomi. Ini terlihat antara lain menjaga tingkat suku bunga acuan.

Dari segi kebijakan makroprudensial, BI juga telah menjaga stabilitas sistem keuangan dan mendorong pemulihan lewat berbagai inisiatif. Salah satunya adalah melonggarkan rasio pinjaman terhadap nilai aset (LTV) untuk properti hingga 100%. Ini meringankan beban uang muka bagi konsumen.

UU PPSK juga menandai terbitnya landasan hukum untuk peran BI terkait monetisasi utang pemerintah saat terjadi krisis. UU sapu jagat ini menambahkan tiga pasal ke dalam UU tentang Pencegahan dan Penanganan Krisis Sistem Keuangan.

Salah satu pasal barunya mengatur tentang kewenangan BI untuk “membeli Surat Berharga Negara (SBN) berjangka panjang di pasar perdana” untuk mengatasi masalah di sistem keuangan yang mengancam ekonomi Indonesia.

Seperti bank sentral di negara-negara lain, BI telah membeli surat-surat utang pemerintah selama pandemi COVID-19. Kewenangan ini merujuk ke UU Nomor 2 Tahun 2020 tentang kebijakan untuk menangani dampak ekonomi dari pandemi.

BI dengan demikian menjadi pembeli siaga (standby buyer) untuk surat utang pemerintah. Hingga 15 November 2022, BI telah membeli Rp142,35 triliun SBN di pasar perdana, menurut Gubernur BI Perry Warjiyo.

UU PPSK juga menyatakan secara eksplisit bahwa pembelian SBN oleh BI tergantung pada keputusan Komite Stabilitas Sistem Keuangan (KSSK). Di bawah UU sapu jagat ini, Menteri Keuangan memperoleh kewenangan untuk mengambil keputusan atas nama KSSK ketika musyawarah dan pengambilan suara gagal.

Teknologi Keuangan

UU PPSK memiliki satu bab khusus soal teknologi keuangan, yaitu Bab XVI. Menurut Pasal 213, ruang lingkupnya meliputi sistem pembayaran, penyelesaian transaksi surat berharga, penghimpunan modal, pengelolaan investasi, pengelolaan risiko, penghimpunan dan/atau penyaluran dana, pendukung pasar, aktivitas terkait aset keuangan digital seperti aset kripto, dan aktivitas jasa keuangan digital lainnya.

Baik BI dan OJK akan melakukan pengaturan dan pengawasan terhadap teknologi keuangan sesuai kewenangan masing-masing, menurut pasal 216.

Untuk OJK, UU PPSK menambahkan tugas lembaga tersebut untuk mengatur dan mengawasi teknologi keuangan dan aset keuangan digital seperti aset kripto. Untuk itu, OJK akan memiliki anggota dewan komisioner baru, yaitu Kepala Eksekutif Pengawas Inovasi Teknologi Sektor Keuangan, Aset Keuangan Digital dan Aset Kripto.

OJK sudah memiliki Satuan Tugas Waspada Investasi (SWI). Walaupun pengawasan terhadap aset kripto bukan tugasnya secara eksplisit, SWI telah menutup beragam platform investasi ilegal. Di antara platform yang telah ditutup, ada 96 platform yang berkaitan dengan aset kripto, menurut data SWI per 15 Desember 2022.

Di samping aset kripto, UU PPSK juga mengatur tentang rupiah digital dengan mengubah UU Nomor 7 Tahun 2011 tentang Mata Uang. UU sapu jagat itu menulis bahwa “BI merupakan satu-satunya lembaga yang berwenang melakukan pengelolaan Rupiah digital.”

BI telah meluncurkan pada November 2022 makalah tentang Proyek Garuda, yaitu inisiatif yang mengeksplorasi desain mata uang digital bank sentral (CBDC) Indonesia atau rupiah digital. BI telah memetakan tiga tahap pengembangan mata uang digital ini. Tahap pertamanya adalah konsultasi publik, kemudian eksperimen teknologi, dan berakhir dengan peninjauan atas posisi kebijakan.

Per Juli 2022, ada empat CBDC yang telah masuk tahap implementasi di dunia, yaitu di Bahamas, Eastern Caribbean, Nigeria, dan Jamaica, menurut data dari Bank for International Settlements (BIS). Pada saat yang sama, ada 29 CBDC yang berada dalam tahap uji coba. BIS juga melaporkan bahwa 72 bank sentral telah mengumumkan bahwa mereka sedang mengerjakan mata uang digital.",Translation Unavailable,0,"[('virtual', 0.04537402), ('financial', 0.028159728), ('risk', 0.027705299), ('european', 0.022151865), ('legal', 0.022136075), ('issued', 0.022047507), ('authority', 0.018713262), ('3', 0.018013643), ('central', 0.017341798), ('trading', 0.015194941)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

Q & A – Bitcoin Israel

Bitcoin is digital virtual currency run by a system based on open source software. No country, company, bank or organization owns or controls Bitcoin.

Digital currency?

Bitcoin is digital currency, and exists solely in the form of digital figures. Each coin has a number identifying it and the user holding it.

So where is my money being held?

In digital files called Bitcoin Wallets, containing sequences of numbers that represent Bitcoins.

What is the real value of a Bitcoin?

As currency, Bitcoin has no real value. However, right now, it is traded at the time of writing this article at 928 USD per Bitcoin, meaning one Bitcoin is worth hundreds of Shekels.

What can I do with it?

You can buy products, but not everywhere, only certain businesses around the world have adopted this currency. To date there is a fairly small number of several thousand stores, hotels, individuals and service providers who accept Bitcoin as payment.

How do I carry out a transaction? Where is it registered?

Since holders of this currency are unknown and anonymous, when transactions are made the details of the currency holders making the transaction do not appear anywhere, only details of the transaction itself – meaning the coins that have switched hands and were transferred from one account to another.

How are Bitcoins made? Who prints them?

Regular currency, like Shekels, is controlled by a central bank that puts it in and takes it out of circulation according to the needs of the market. Bitcoin has no central bank, and new coins go into circulation through ""mining"", meaning a computerized action carried out through solving complex equations that ultimately create the unique, encrypted code of each Bitcoin. In essence, any computer can ""mine"" new coins.

Is there a limit to the number of Bitcoins ""mined""?

As time goes by, less and less Bitcoins are available for ""mining"". Between 2008 and 2012, 10.5 million Bitcoins were ""mined"". Over the next four years, only 5.25 million Bitcoins will be available for ""mining"", and the number of Bitcoins in circulation can never exceed 21 million.

How do I go about obtaining Bitcoins?

There are a number of ways. Other than ""mining"", the most common way for consumers to obtain Bitcoins is to exchange ""regular"" money, such as US Dollars or Israeli Shekels, for Bitcoins in digital foreign exchanges websites, much like buying foreign currency at exchange points or banks. Just like any currency, Bitcoin has an exchange rate with all leading currency in the world that goes up and down according to its demand. Also, if you are interested in trading in Bitcoins, you could sell your car, for instance, and be paid with Bitcoins.

What are the advantages of Bitcoin?

It is a global, anonymous and virtual currency that can be transferred from one account to another with a click at no extra charge. It is also ostensibly resistant to local financial crises. Since it is totally anonymous, it allows spenders to avoid governmental regulation and buy products and services anonymously.

What are the disadvantages of Bitcoin?

Not all Israeli businesses accept it, it is virtual and therefore less tangible than physical currency, and it has yet to be recognized by the Central Bank of Israel, as can be seen from its response below. Other establishments are also wary of accepting it, and its trade is limited because it can be easily used in money laundering.

Is it legal in Israel?

To date no law prohibits using and/or trading in Bitcoin, and it is therefore legal.

Who invented Bitcoin?

Officially, the invention of this currency is attributed to a Japanese software developer called Satoshi Nakamoto, however, in August 2008, The New Yorker and Fast Company acknowledged three engineers – Neal King, Vladimir Oksman and Charles Bry – as the original developers of Bitcoin based on a patent application they had filed which contained encryption technologies similar to those used in Bitcoin, as well as statements similar to those found in the Bitcoin whitepaper. The three have denied their involvement.

What is Bitcoin's legal status in Israel?

As mentioned, Bitcoin does not meet the criteria for currency according to Israeli law, and therefore money laundering laws and other regulations associated with currency service provision cannot be applied to it. Relevant laws may be amended in future.

Will tax be applied to Bitcoin transactions in Israel?

Bitcoin transactions are liable to tax like any other transaction, with several differences. First, Bitcoin transactions, much like other foreign currency transactions, require translation into Shekels. Second, since Bitcoin transactions cannot be monitored and traced effectively and exhaustively, it is difficult to tax them and this leaves a form of dishonest ""loophole"".

Will sellers be liable to tax if exchange rates go up as a result of Bitcoin being sold in Israel?

Meaning if I buy Bitcoin today at $928, when each US Dollar is worth 3.5 Shekels, and the USD exchange rate goes up, so that when I sell my Bitcoin each Dollar is worth 4 Shekels, will I have to pay income tax on the difference, since, as some tax experts argue, it will be regarded as profit? It is possible that this ""profit"" will be taxed in the same way as linkage differentials are, however, this is not the case across the board, as section 3(13) to the Income Tax Ordinance (New Version) 5721 – 1961 (hereinafter: the Ordinance) states that in some cases where an individual has received income from such rise in foreign exchange rates, s/he will not be liable to income tax if s/he meets all 3 criteria exempting him/her from paying income tax for gains made from a rise in foreign exchange rates.

The criteria are:

· If linkage (exchange rate) differentials are not partial linkage (exchange rate) differentials. This criterion is met, since a rise in Bitcoin exchange rates does not constitute partial linkage differential, as defined in the income tax regulations (establishing partial linkage differentials), 5763 – 2003.

· If the individual has not demanded the deduction of interest expenses or linkage differentials on account of the property.

· If the linkage differentials do not constitute income under section 2(1) to the Ordinance (""gain or profit from any business or occupation … or from a transaction or commercial venture"") and are not registered or are required to be so registered.

Law in Israel – Updates

Class action against FIBI Group

The FIBI Group (the First International Bank of Israel, the Otsar Hahayal Bank and UBANK) has put a new policy in place whereby clients may not transfer funds in order to purchase Bitcoins, and has sent letters to clients demanding that they refrain from doing so. According to Bitcoin Israel, this demand is illegal and several FIBI clients are now taking steps to file a class action suit against the group.

Meeting with MK Tamar Zandberg (Meretz)

On December 29th, 2013 Bitcoin Israel met with MK Zandberg, who expressed interest in helping them solve issues with Bitcoin that are currently vague and obscure. Among the modes of action that were raised during this meeting were official letters to the Central Bank of Israel to receive more information on its position on Bitcoin, and raising awareness to the currency during a session held by one or more Knesset committees.

As part of this article we have asked for responses from the Central Bank of Israel and Bitcoin Israel.

Mr. Ron Gross of Bitcoin Israel said on January 1st, 2014:

""Bitcoin Israel's position is that Bitcoin's legal/tax status should be the same as any other currency.

According to the opinion we obtained from a leading Israeli accounting firm, Bitcoin should be taxed just like any other currency – tax should be paid for income measured in Bitcoin, but capital gains should not be taxed (capital gain from foreign currency is not liable to tax under Israeli law). In addition, there is no law prohibiting the use of or trade in Bitcoin, and therefore it is legal to use it.

Where the authorities stand:

1. The Central Bank of Israel was asked early this year by various banks and companies to ascertain how Bitcoin may be regulated. It responded that so far it has no opinion on the matter, and does not intend to prohibit banks from using this currency. However, it also has no intention of forcing banks to allow clients to make transactions using Bitcoins. In practice this position is problematic, because banks fear various money laundering issues, even those that are irrelevant to Bitcoin, and as part of their risk-aversive policy avoid this currency and reject any transaction that has a Bitcoin air about it.

2. The Tax Authority has issued a general statement in the past whereby it intends to tax Bitcoin, but has not given any further details.

3. We are currently working on obtaining more detailed statements from various official bodies, and a meeting has been held in this vein this week with MK Zandberg.""

Mr. Yoav Sofer, Acting Bank of Israel Spokesman, said on January 1st, 2014:

""The Bank of Israel is following global developments in this area, and particularly steps involving policy and regulation, and is looking into the need to regularize electronic, virtual and other such currency in some form or another.""

Initial Officer Training Programme (IOTP) provides basic military officer training to Officer Cadets (OCdts) and their equivalents from law enforcement and uniformed services. The programme falls within the tactical level of the Professional Military Education (PME) framework of armed forces and is modelled from the Royal Military Academy Sandhursts’ (RMAS) Commissioning Course. It was designed with the direct support and guidance of RMAS Instructing and Support Staff.

Rationale

Traditionally, the Jamaica Defence Force’s (JDF) longstanding partnerships with militaries across the world has seen its OCdts being trained in academies in the following countries: United States, England, Canada, China and India. Upon the return of OCdts to the JDF, there is a requirement for doctrine and operating procedure standardization due to the varying concepts and differing contents of the training they had undergone. This is normally done at the Unit level and later, through a Young Officers’ Course. The advent of COVID-19 added a new level of complexity to travel, thus negatively affecting the process of sending OCdts overseas. Additionally, the ongoing expansion and restructuring of the Force to cauterize the ballooning threats to national security has caused an increased demand for newly commissioned Second Lieutenants.

Due to the carefully adapted military and academic curricula, IOTP serves as the course to treat with the aforementioned considerations. The methodology used addresses each issue directly and the course, through the delivery of a bespoke training syllabus, is fit for the JDF and is also relevant to the militaries and organizations within the Caribbean region and in other parts of the world.

Concept

Having the RMAS approach to training at its core, IOTP is designed with a syllabus that sees male and female integration throughout training. The course focusses on developing military skills and command with a leadership ‘golden thread’. The course structure allows the Instructing Staff to educate, build, develop and scrutinize an OCdt’s ability to decide and communicate accurately and ethically while under pressure and or stress. The expectation is that on commissioning, an OCdt will be fully cognizant of the responsibilities and personal conditions that being an Officer imposes upon them. The product of the IOTP will be an ethical and robust Officer who has the knowledge, skills, attitudes and intellectual agility to adapt their decision-making process and approach to any environment.

Location

The home of IOTP is the Caribbean Military Academy (CMA) Newcastle, which is located at the Newcastle Hill Station, St Andrew, Jamaica.

Nestled in the cool hills of upper St Andrew and amidst beautiful trees, ferns, ground orchids, delicate wild flowers and a profusion of ginger lilies, is the Newcastle

Training Depot founded in 1841 by Major General Sir William Maynard Gomm (later Field Marshall). Gomm, a veteran of the wars against revolutionary France and Lieutenant Governor of Jamaica from 1840 to 1841, relentlessly badgered the War Office in London to establish a mountain station for British soldiers in Jamaica soon after taking up his post.

The idea of the hill station was first raised by Gomm in a letter dated April 7, 1840 to Governor Sir Charles Metcalfe. Gomm pointed out that while Up Park Camp was an ideal location for a barracks, it was subject to the ravages of yellow fever. In Jamaica the

British garrison was stationed on the plain at Up Park Camp, Stony Hill, Fort Augusta and Port Royal. Here, on the average, 1 soldier died every 2½ days. According to Russell, the year 1838 was considered a ‘good’ year: only 91 men died. In 1839, 110 men perished and in the following year 121. Initially, the British government was conservative in approving a hill station for the troops in Jamaica. They were concerned about the expense of the venture.

In May 1841, London finally sanctioned Gomm’s efforts to build what is thought to be the first permanent mountain station in the British West Indies at Newcastle. The site selected was a coffee plantation protruding from the southern face of the grand ridge of the Blue Mountains. The British government paid £4,230 for the Newcastle site.

At the outbreak of World War II (1939-1945), life at Newcastle changed a little. The British regiment was replaced by Canadian regiments which remained at Newcastle for the duration of the war. With hostilities over in 1945, the Canadians left and once again a British battalion was stationed there.

In 1958, the West Indies Federation was founded and the infantry regiments of the various Caribbean islands were disbanded and reorganized into the West India Regiment. Newcastle became a training depot, training recruits from all over the West Indies as part of the

newly formed West Indies Federation. In 1962 when Federation was disbanded, the West India Regiment was also disbanded. Jamaica simultaneously sought her independence, which was achieved on August 6, 1962. With independence, Newcastle was given to the Jamaican government as part of a general settlement of all military lands in Jamaica.",Translation Unavailable,0,"[('virtual', 0.04537402), ('financial', 0.028159728), ('risk', 0.027705299), ('european', 0.022151865), ('legal', 0.022136075), ('issued', 0.022047507), ('authority', 0.018713262), ('3', 0.018013643), ('central', 0.017341798), ('trading', 0.015194941)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

政府は7日午前の閣議で、インターネット上の仮想通貨「ビットコイン」に関する初の公式見解を決定した。「通貨には該当しない」と認定し、貴金属などと同じ「商品（モノ）」と扱う方向性を示した。銀行や証券会社が売買の仲介など本業で取り扱うことを禁止し、取引に伴う売買益は課税対象になるとの見解も明確にした。

政府見解は取引所の破綻などで混迷しているビットコインに関する日本での取引ルールの土台となる。見解によると、仮想通貨は民法が定める通貨に該当しないと明記。通貨の取り扱いを前提とする銀行法の対象外とした。金融商品取引法に基づく有価証券にもあたらないとした。この結果、現時点では投資家保護の対象から外れる。

今回の見解に基づき、政府は金融機関での取り扱いルールも示した。民間銀行にはビットコインの売買の仲介や通貨との交換、専用口座の開設、送金業務などを認めない。証券会社も仲介業務など本業は禁じられる。

ただ、ビットコインに投資するファンドやデリバティブ（金融派生商品）の組成は理論上は可能で、この業務の是非については明記を避けた。

課税については、所得税や法人税、消費税を例示した上で、「（それぞれに定める）課税要件を満たす場合には課税対象になる」と明記した。菅義偉官房長官は同日の記者会見で、「取引で利益をあげたのであれば、財務省とすればどういう形で課税できるか考えるのは当然のこと」と語った。

政府見解は、民主党の大久保勉参院議員が提出した質問主意書に対する「答弁書」として閣議決定した。ビットコインは2009年に誕生したが、法律上の定義が不明確だった。

ビットコインを巡っては大手取引所の「マウントゴックス」が先月末に経営破綻し、時価で470億円前後のビットコインと、最大28億円に上る顧客からの預かり金が消失していることが判明していた。","If you would like to sharing articles in a company, reprinting / duplication to conferences, or ordering order, please see the link.

At the Cabinet meeting on the morning of the 7th, the government decided the first official view of the virtual currency on the Internet ""Bitcoin"".It was certified as ""not applicable to currency"", and showed the direction of ""product (thing)"" the same as precious metals.Banks and securities companies banned from handling them in their main business, such as buying and selling, and clarified that trading gains associated with transactions would be taxable.

The government view is the foundation of Japan's trading rules for bitcoin, which is confused due to the collapse of exchanges.According to views, virtual currency does not fall under the currency specified by the Civil Code.It was excluded from the Bank Law that assumes the handling of currency.He said that it would not be a securities based on the Financial Instruments and Exchange Law.As a result, at this time, it is out of the subject of investor protection.

Based on this view, the government also showed rules for financial institutions.Private banks do not allow Bitcoin to buy and sell, exchange for currency, open a dedicated account, and remittance.Securities companies are prohibited from brokerage.

However, the composition of funds and derivatives (financial derivative products) investing in bitcoin is theoretically possible, and we avoided this business.

Regarding the taxation, the income tax, corporate tax, and consumption tax are illustrated, and the tax requirements (specified in each) are stated that taxation is subject to tax.At a press conference on the same day, Secretary -General Yoshiyoshi Kan said, ""If you make a profit in transactions, it is natural to think about what you can do with the Ministry of Finance.""

The government's view was a Cabinet decision as a ""answer"" for the questioner submitted by Democratic Representative Tsutomu Okubo.Bitcoin was born in 2009, but the legal definition was unclear.

The CBJ said in a statement e-mailed to The Jordan Times that investing in virtual currencies carries high risks of devaluation as users could be hit by severe fluctuation and volatility of its value and risks of financial crimes, hacking and electronic piracy, along with the potential risk of the total loss of its value due to the absence of guarantor or underlying assets.

The CBJ urged people to make prudent decisions regarding any investment instrument that lacks adequate transparency and disclosure, and which does not entail consumer protection measures.

She added that the bank has been following the issue of bitcoin very closely over the past two months, adding it was important to warn the public against it in order to avoid any fraud problems in the future.

121,Kosovo,Ban on mining[155]," In January 2022, coinciding with an energy crisis, Kosovo outlawed all cryptocurrency mining. According to BBC News, cryptocurrency mining ""is particularly popular in northern areas of Kosovo, where ethnic Serbs do not recognise the state's independence and refuse to pay electricity bills"".[156]",156,cite_note-156,https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2022/jan/16/panic-as-kosovo-pulls-the-plug-on-its-energy-guzzling-bitcoin-miners,"['16 January 2022', '22 January 2022']",156,"For bitcoin enthusiasts in Kosovo with a breezy attitude to risk, it has been a good week to strike a deal on computer equipment that can create, or “mine”, the cryptocurrency.

From Facebook to Telegram, new posts in the region’s online crypto groups became dominated by dismayed Kosovans attempting to sell off their mining equipment – often at knockdown prices.

“There’s a lot of panic and they’re selling it or trying to move it to neighbouring countries,” said cryptoKapo, a crypto investor and administrator of some of the region’s largest online crypto communities.

The frenetic social media action follows an end-of-year announcement by Kosovo’s government of an immediate, albeit temporary, ban on all crypto mining activity as part of emergency measures to ease a crippling energy crisis.

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are created or “mined” by high-powered computers that compete to solve complex mathematical puzzles in what is a highly energy-intensive process that rewards people based on the amount of computing power they provide.

The incentive to get into the mining game in Kosovo, one of Europe’s poorest countries, is obvious. The cryptocurrency currently trades at more than £31,500 a bitcoin, while Kosovo has the cheapest energy prices in Europe due in part to more than 90% of the domestic energy production coming from burning the country’s rich reserves of lignite, a low-grade coal, and fuel bills being subsidised by the government.

The largest-scale crypto mining is thought to be taking place in the north of the country, where the Serb-majority population refuse to recognise Kosovo as an independent state and have consequently not paid for electricity for more than two decades.

There is serious money to be made – and in a time of ready energy supply it was being made. The number of people mining cryptocurrencies in Kosovo is thought to have skyrocketed in recent years. Groups such as Albanian Crypto Amateurs on Facebook and Crypto Eagles on Telegram have exploded with thousands of new members, though it is unclear how many are mining cryptocurrency, or on what scale.

But the good times appear to be over – at least for now – and the developments in Kosovo highlight one of the big questions about the future of bitcoin and other such digital currency.

The latest calculation from Cambridge University’s bitcoin electricity consumption index suggests that global bitcoin mining consumes 125.96 terawatt hours a year of electricity, putting its consumption above Norway (122.2 TWh), Argentina (121 TWh), the Netherlands (108.8 TWh) and the United Arab Emirates (113.20 TWh).

Meanwhile, Kosovans spent the final days of 2021 in darkness as domestic and international factors combined to cause energy shortages and rolling blackouts across the country. At the peak of the recent crisis, an unforeseen shutdown at one of its two ageing power plants left Kosovo importing about 40% of its energy on international markets – where prices have soared – and the government was forced to provide an emergency subsidy to help meet the costs.

Kosovo’s minister of economy, Dr Artane Rizvanolli, said the ban had been a “no-brainer”.

“We have allocated €20m for subsidising energy, which is probably not going to be sufficient, and this is taxpayers’ money that is going to subsidise electricity consumption,” she said. “On the other hand we have crypto mining, which is a highly energy-intensive activity and is not regulated.”

Kosovo is not alone. Last September, the 10 most powerful regulators in China vowed to kill off what was then the world’s biggest cryptocurrency mining industry.

In Iceland, the country’s national power company, Landsvirkjun, has said it will turn away potential cryptocurrency miners as the country is experiencing power shortages. Last week, a powerful committee in the US Congress announced it would convene a hearing on the issue. US cryptocurrency miners are believed to be the largest consumers of energy, followed by Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation.

“It’s time to understand and address the steep energy and environmental impacts it is having on our communities and our planet,” said committee chairman Frank Pallone and Diana DeGette, who heads its oversight panel.

Alex de Vries, a Paris-based economist, said his initial estimates in a paper to be published later this year suggest just a quarter of the energy used by miners is renewable: “The question really is: what are you getting in return for that?”

Jason Deane, chief bitcoin analyst at Quantum Economics, said he believed there were a host of advantages, including the offer of instant, virtually free, financial transactions carried out without the use of a third party, with certainty that there will be instant settlement, and that the current teething problems need to be put in perspective.

Since the Kosovan authorities made the decision, police and customs officers have begun conducting regular raids, seizing hundreds of pieces of hardware.

While a 60-day state of energy emergency remains in place, the prospect of upcoming regulation and energy bill price rises leaves the future anything but certain.

on the spread and use of the “virtual currency”, in particular, bitcoins (bitcoin)

National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic notes that recently the world has seen the emergence and spread of such new phenomenon of “virtual currency”, in particular,bitcoins (bitcoin).They are also called “cryptcurrency”, “digital currency”, “decentralized virtual currency” (hereinafter “virtual currency”).In Kyrgyzstan also it could be observed attempts to spread and use the“virtual currency”, to popularize them among the population of our country.

At the same time we should not forget that under the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic the sole legal tender on the territory of our country is the national currency of Kyrgyzstan “som”.And the use of “virtual currency”, bitcoins, in particular, as a means of payment in the Kyrgyz Republic will be a violation of the law of our state.

In this regard, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic considers necessary to inform the population about the risks and consequences associated with the use of “virtual currency”.

1. Risks associated with the lack of security.Nobody has obligationsonthis“virtual currency” and they do not have the material (financial) support.As opposed to the traditional paper-based or non-cash money held in banks, such “virtual currency” does not have a tangible materialexpression, operates on the basis of distributed electronic networks and their circulation is carried out only within that network.

2. Lack of real value of “virtual currency”.Operations on their purchase-sale and exchange for other traditional currencies can be providedthrough special terminals, so-called “bitcoin ATM”, or so-called “virtual exchanges” or “exchange offices”, where the formation of prices and the exchange rate of “virtual currency” is realized. “The cost of “virtual currency” is not tied to any currency or other asset, and, in fact, the formation of its cost is influencedby demand and supply for it, that creates high risks of exchange rate volatility and loss of value.

3. Risks in calculations with “virtual currency”.Purchasing of “virtual currency”is made directly, without the mediation of any financial institutions.Cancel of transactions is impossible.Due to the fact that the system has no control center, it is impossible to appeal or cancel unauthorized transactions.If payment has been made, but the service or goods were not received, there is no guarantee of refund.In case of theft of “virtual currency” it is impossible to get it back because in the “virtual currency” system the personality of its members are anonymous and reverse transaction without the consent of both parties is not possible.

“Virtual currency”is regulated by no central government agency in the world.Distribution ofpeer-to-peer network and the lack of any center makes public or private regulation of systemalmost impossible.

In connection with the foregoing, subject to high risks, the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic strongly recommends resist from use of “virtual currency”,do not participate in the operations of their purchase and sale and exchange for other currencies or assets, do not provide or receive “virtual currency” as payment for goods, services and works.

National Bank notes that “virtual currency” is not governed by the laws of the Kyrgyz Republic and for today no legal and regulatory framework for the regulation of relations connected with “virtual currency”.

Thus, persons or entities in any way using “virtual currency” subject to the abovementionedrisks.And also, when involved in these activities, they assume all the possible negative consequences of the possible violation of the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic.","Warning of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic

AKIPRESS.COM - On April 2, the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange and the International Financial Center Development Agency published a report on ""the Legal Status of Blockchain Commerce in the Kyrgyz Republic"" commissioned from international legal experts.

The goal of the legal research was to determine how the legislation of Kyrgyzstan correlates with the blockchain-based commerce: cryptocurrency trading and investments, crypto mining, exchange trading in crypto-assets and the public placement of crypto-instruments through ICOs ('initial coin offerings').

The report highlights:

1. The authors of the report are fully in agreement with the position of the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic that non-professional investment of savings into crypto-assets carries an unacceptable risk.

2. The authors see the following blockchain-based opportunities for Kyrgyzstan:

- to optimize securities settlements (a pilot project is being organized with the Kyrgyz Stock Exchange);

- to use blockchain for Government registers and State procurement procedures;

- to offer the investment services infrastructure of Kyrgyzstan (exchanges, investment companies) to global crypto-asset investors enabling them to deal in crypto-assets within a liberal but well regulated legal regime;

- to make Kyrgyzstan a regional centre for startup IPOs by allowing company promoters to raise funds by issuing securities in a regulated, but user-friendly manner and at the same time supplementing the functionality of the offering and subsequent trading with the use of crypto-currencies and tokens, to enhance the liquidity of the securities.

The authors of the report, led by Director of the International Finance Centre Development Agency and Executive Chairman of the Swiss-Central Asian Business Council Valery Tutykhin concluded that the legislation of the Kyrgyz Republic is very friendly to crypto-asset commerce. Without a need for legislative reforms Kyrgyzstan can now satisfy the demand of global crypto-investors and blockchain business developers for a liberal, but well regulated jurisdiction. Authors of the report added: ""This activity must be done with due regard to the local tax law, anti-money laundering controls, consumer and investor protection norms and other legislation regulating the ordinary commerce.""

The authors of the report believe that today, “Kyrgyz jurisdiction allows the development of blockchain projects on an international scale without the need to amend the legislation.”

In mid-March 2018 the report was discussed with all the relevant Government departments. We stress, however, that this is a private initiative of the investment market participants.

Jeg er svært fornøyd med at det nå har kommet en avklaring på dette spørsmålet. Dette ivaretar hensynet til likebehandling og forutberegnelighet, sier finansminister Siv Jensen (FrP).

Bitcoin er en desentralisert digital valuta, noe som betyr at den hverken er utstedt eller regulert av noen sentralbank. Skattedirektoratet har tidligere lagt til grunn at veksling av bitcoin ikke er omfattet av merverdiavgiftsunntaket for finansielle tjenester og dermed er en avgiftspliktig tjeneste. I EU er tilsvarende tjeneste unntatt fra merverdiavgift etter en avgjørelse i EU-domstolen 22. oktober 2015. Etter EU-domstolens avgjørelse ba Finansdepartementet Skattedirektoratet om å vurdere merverdiavgiftsbehandlingen av digital valuta på nytt. I sin fornyede vurdering konkluderte Skattedirektoratet med at tjenester som gjelder veksling av bitcoin er omfattet av unntaket for finansielle tjenester i merverdiavgiftsloven. Finansdepartementet er enig i direktoratets vurdering av spørsmålet.

Les brevet fra Finansdepartementet","- Some have experienced uncertainty related to the tax treatment of bitcoin.I am very pleased that there has now been clarification on this issue.This safeguards the consideration of equal treatment and predictability, says Finance Minister Siv Jensen (Frp).

Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency, which means that it is neither issued nor regulated by any central bank.The Directorate of Taxes has previously assumed that the exchange of bitcoin is not covered by the VAT exemption for financial services and thus is a taxable service.In the EU, corresponding service is exempt from value added tax following a decision in the European Court of Justice on October 22, 2015. Following the decision of the European Court of Justice, the Ministry of Finance asked the Tax Directorate to reconsider the VAT processing of digital currency.In its renewed assessment, the Directorate of Taxes concluded that services relating to Bitcoin are covered by the exception for financial services in the Value Added Tax Act.The Ministry of Finance agrees with the Directorate's assessment of the question.

Consultado por EL FINANCIERO, Carlos Orta, vicepresidente de Política Regulatoria de la CNBV, explicó que la Ley Fintech, que sigue siendo un proyecto, podrá regular a las plataformas que ofrecen al público comprar y vender ""activos virtuales"", o realizar con estos transferencias y pagos a través de dichas plataformas.



Estos activos virtuales estarán definidos como una unidad digital cuyo uso por el público sea similar a aquel que corresponda a la moneda de curso legal, siendo el Banco de México (Banxico) quien determinará lo que será considerado como ""activos virtuales"" para que estos únicamente sean operados a través de plataformas autorizadas y supervisadas por la CNBV.

Carlos Orta detalló que ""la CNBV no supervisa aún a dicho sector, por lo que no ha llevado a cabo revisiones de estafas, lavado de dinero o fraudes; por ello, es importante la promulgación de la Ley, puesto que otorgará facultades a la Comisión para regular y supervisar a estas plataformas con el fin de aminorar los riesgo antes mencionados, entre otros"".



El vicepresidente de Política Regulatoria de la CNBV precisó que la justificación de reconocer ciertas criptomonedas y regular a las plataformas que ofrezcan al público adquirirlas, es la protección al consumidor, debido a los riesgos que representa la operación de dichos activos.



Por ejemplo, dijo, los bitcoins tienen una alta volatilidad, por lo que las personas deben tener muy claro que al mantener bitcoins su patrimonio puede verse afectado y dicho riesgo deberá ser dado a conocer por las plataformas a través de las cuales se operen activos virtuales similares a los bitcoins.



MENOR RIESGO DE FRAUDE

​

Asimismo, los riesgos de fraude o de uso indebido de datos personales se aminoran en una plataforma al ser una entidad autorizada, regulada y supervisada por las autoridades financieras.



Con base a lo anterior, Daniel Vogel, presidente y co-fundador de Bitso, afirmó que ""en México ya se está negociando una regulación, sobre todo en lo Fintech, con varias empresas de fondeo colectivo o plataformas de pagos de bitcoin o monedas virtuales; pensamos que se va a conseguir este año.



""El tema de la confianza es interesante, en nuestra plataforma la gente pone un alto grado de confianza, pero nosotros pensamos que una empresa como la nuestra debe ser regulada. Puede ser que nosotros hagamos bien las cosas y nunca sabes si las demás personas son honestas"", aseveró Vogel.



En tanto, el funcionario de la CNBV resaltó que sólo si el Banxico otorga a los bitcoins el carácter de activos virtuales y a través de las plataformas se pueden comprar y vender, o realizar transferencias y pagos con bitcoins, las plataformas deberán requerir la autorización de la CNBV para operar.



Dicha autorización se otorgará con el previo acuerdo de un comité en el que participará la Secretaría de Hacienda, la CNBV y el Banxico. Asimismo, la CNBV llevará un registro que será público en su página de internet de las plataformas que hayan sido autorizadas para operar con activos virtuales, concluyó.","Given the growth in the popularity of collective anchorage companies, crowfunding, and for payment platforms with bitcoins or cryptocurrento reduce fraud events, scams and money laundering that could occur with these technologies.



Consulted by El Financiero, Carlos Orta, Vice President of Regulatory Policy of the CNBV, explained that the Fintech law, which remains a project, may regulate the platforms that offer the public to buy and sell ""virtual assets"", or make with these transfersand payments through these platforms.



These virtual assets will be defined as a digital unit whose use by the public is similar to the one that corresponds to the legal tender, being the Bank of Mexico (Banxico) who will determine what will be considered as ""virtual assets"" so that these onlyare operated through authorized and supervised platforms by the CNBV.

Carlos Orta explained that ""the CNBV does not yet supervise that sector, so it has not carried out scam reviews, money laundering or fraud; therefore, the promulgation of the law is important, since it will grant powers to the commissionto regulate and supervise these platforms in order to reduce the aforementioned risk, among others. ""



The Vice President of Regulatory Policy of the CNBV said that the justification of recognizing certain cryptocurrencies and regular the platforms that offer the public to acquire them, is consumer protection, due to the risks of the operation of said assets.



For example, he said, Bitcoins have high volatility, so people must be very clear that keeping bitcoins their heritage can be affected and said risk must be disclosed by platforms through which virtual assets are operatedsimilar to bitcoins.



Lower fraud risk



Likewise, the risks of fraud or improper use of personal data are reduced on a platform to be an authorized entity, regulated and supervised by the financial authorities.



Based on the above, Daniel Vogel, president and co-founder of Bitso, said that ""in Mexico a regulation is already being negotiated, especially in the Fintech, with several collective funding companies or Bitcoin payment platforms or virtual currenciesWe think it will be achieved this year.



""The issue of trust is interesting, on our platform people put a high degree of trust, but we think that a company like ours must be regulated. It may be that we do things well and you never know if other people areHonest, ""said Vogel.



Meanwhile, the CNBV official stressed that only if Banxico gives Bitcoins the character of virtual assets and through the platforms can be purchased and sold, or making transfers and payments with bitcoins, the platforms must require the authorization of theCNBV to operate.



This authorization will be granted with the prior agreement of a committee in which the Ministry of Finance, the CNBV and the Banxico will participate.Likewise, the CNBV will keep a record that will be public on its website of the platforms that have been authorized to operate with virtual assets, he concluded.",6,"[('cryptocurrency', 0.031768546), ('virtual', 0.029607689), ('use', 0.02090096), ('state', 0.020772124), ('payment', 0.020059291), ('legal', 0.019635182), ('ban', 0.017162815), ('government', 0.016882187), ('bitcoins', 0.015462362), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.015034701)]",0,"[('use', 0.062151197), ('copyright', 0.024864022), ('library', 0.019866286), ('government', 0.019797979), ('item', 0.018867392), ('law', 0.018566867), ('bitcoin', 0.017421842), ('reuse', 0.017286222), ('right', 0.016354026), ('permission', 0.016217122)]"

The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) on Tuesday, January 17, has passed a circular to inform all Nigerian banks that all transaction in bitcoin and other virtual currencies have been banned in Nigeria.

Central Bank of Nigeria bans transaction of virtual currencies

The CBN directive is coming after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued a warning against virtual currencies.

READ ALSO: How to make money online

According to a report by Premium Times, the circular signed by CBN’s director of financial policy and ‎regulation department, Kelvin Amugo, stated that the move was necessitated by money laundering and terrorism financing risks inherent in operations of virtual currencies.

The circular read: “The emergence of Virtual Currencies (VCs) has attracted investments in payments infrastructure that provides new methods of transmitting value over the internet.

“Transactions in VCs are largely untraceable and anonymous making them susceptible to abuse by criminals, especially in money laundering and financing of terrorism.

“VCs are traded in exchange platforms that are unregulated, all over the world. Consumers may, therefore, lose their money without any legal redress in the event these exchanges collapse or close business.

“The development of VCs Payment Products and Services (VCPPS) and their interactions with other New Payment Products and Services (NPPS), give rise to the need for guidance to protect the integrity of the Nigerian financial system. There is, therefore, the need to address the Money Laundering/Terrorism Financing risks associated with VC exchanges and any other type of institutions that act as nodes where convertible VC activities intersect with the regulated fiat currency financial system.

“The attention of banks and other reporting financial institutions is hereby drawn to the above risks and you are required to take the following actions pending substantive regulation or decision by the CBN.”

The Central Bank therefore advised banks to ensure that they do not use, hold, and transact in virtual currencies.

CBN also warned the banks to ensure that existing customers that are virtual currency exchangers have effective AML/CFT controls that enable them to comply with customer identification, verification and transaction monitoring requirements.

“Where banks or other financial institutions are not satisfied with the controls put in place by the virtual currency exchangers/customers, the relationship should be discontinued immediately; and any suspicious transactions by these customers should immediately be reported to the Nigerian Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU).”

The CBN stressed that virtual currencies such as Bitcoin, Ripples, Monero, Litecoin, Dogecion, Onecoin and similar products are not legal tenders in Nigeria, thus any bank or institution that transacts in such business does so at its own risk.

Meanwhile, a Nigerian man, Daniel Onowugbeda has called on the Economic and Financial Crime Commission (EFCC) to help him arrest an alleged fake bitcoin seller who duped him.

According to him, he contacted the bitcoin seller on Twitter, a user identified as, @BuyBitcoinsNg. He was asked to pay N100,000 but the seller blocked him immediately after he paid the money into the account given to him.

Addressing a conference organised by the financial affairs parliamentary committee, Muscat said that Malta will become one of the first countries in the world to embrace blockchain and that the strategy will soon be put up for public consultation.

“This is not just about Bitcoin, and I also look forward to seeing blockchain technology implemented in the Lands Registry and the national health registries,” he said. “Malta can be a global trail-blazer in this regard.”

Muscat reiterated his call on the EU to harness the potential of cryptocurrencies and seek to become the “Bitcoin continent of Europe”.

“I understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it’s coming,” he said bluntly. “We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them. We must be the ones that others copy.”

Labour MP Silvio Schembri, who chairs the financial affairs committee, said that his dream is for Malta to become “the Silicon Valley of Europe”.

“We should aim to have the world’s best environment for the development and commercialisation of Fintech models and disruptive innovation,” he said. “The government should ensure that Malta has the appropriate regulatory framework, the right tax system and the best infrastructure to support this ambition.

“With our geographical position and weather conditions, strong financial system, skills base, entrepreneurial spirit and can-do approach, Malta can truly serve as a test-bed for new sectors and foreign firms to test their new technology and products locally.”

He added that if Malta managed to attract a mere 1% of the UK’s Fintech industry to Malta post-Brexit, it would mean an injection of €200 million into the local economy.

Muscat’s speech was welcomed by the Malta Gaming Authority executive chairman Joseph Cuschieri, who said that he will later this year announce plans related to cryptocurrencies in the gaming context.

He said that plans are also in the pipeline to set up a national betting exchange where bets can be hedged, as well as a European Gaming Institute that will provide targeted and sector-specific training.

It also received the praise of Abdalla Kablan, the chief scientific officer of Sixcap, a Singapore-based digital company.

“Malta is well placed to tap into blockchain, as it has fantastic financial services and IT sectors and it’s just a matter of bridging the gap,” he said. “Many in Singapore believe Malta can become the Fintech capital of the world, and we can truly take the world by storm.”

He predicted that the use of blockchain technology will soon explode in popularity, just as the internet did in the 1990s following the introduction of web broswers.

“Blockchain technology will decentralise financial services just as the internet has decentralised the media and information,” he said.","Cabinet has approved the first draft of a national strategy to promote blockchain, the technology underlying the Bitcoin cryptocurrency, Prime Minister Joseph Muscat has revealed.

“I understand that regulators are wary of this technology but the fact is that it’s coming,” he said bluntly. “We must be on the frontline in embracing this crucial innovation, and we cannot just wait for others to take action and copy them. We must be the ones that others copy.”

Labour MP Silvio Schembri, who chairs the financial affairs committee, said that his dream is for Malta to become “the Silicon Valley of Europe”.

“We should aim to have the world’s best environment for the development and commercialisation of Fintech models and disruptive innovation,” he said. “The government should ensure that Malta has the appropriate regulatory framework, the right tax system and the best infrastructure to support this ambition.

“With our geographical position and weather conditions, strong financial system, skills base, entrepreneurial spirit and can-do approach, Malta can truly serve as a test-bed for new sectors and foreign firms to test their new technology and products locally.”

He added that if Malta managed to attract a mere 1% of the UK’s Fintech industry to Malta post-Brexit, it would mean an injection of €200 million into the local economy.

Muscat’s speech was welcomed by the Malta Gaming Authority executive chairman Joseph Cuschieri, who said that he will later this year announce plans related to cryptocurrencies in the gaming context.

He said that plans are also in the pipeline to set up a national betting exchange where bets can be hedged, as well as a European Gaming Institute that will provide targeted and sector-specific training.

It also received the praise of Abdalla Kablan, the chief scientific officer of Sixcap, a Singapore-based digital company.

“Malta is well placed to tap into blockchain, as it has fantastic financial services and IT sectors and it’s just a matter of bridging the gap,” he said. “Many in Singapore believe Malta can become the Fintech capital of the world, and we can truly take the world by storm.”

He predicted that the use of blockchain technology will soon explode in popularity, just as the internet did in the 1990s following the introduction of web broswers.

“Blockchain technology will decentralise financial services just as the internet has decentralised the media and information,” he said.",1,"[('cryptocurrency', 0.039894804), ('financial', 0.03495469), ('2018', 0.020681204), ('exchange', 0.0182124), ('transaction', 0.017677767), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.017443212), ('trading', 0.01689826), ('ban', 0.015825065), ('payment', 0.014948157), ('regulation', 0.012330683)]",2,"[('currency', 0.09388384), ('virtual', 0.07480048), ('exchange', 0.02187321), ('bank', 0.020692494), ('risk', 0.020221485), ('payment', 0.01970069), ('asset', 0.018782483), ('said', 0.018687367), ('crypto', 0.018663619), ('use', 0.018432228)]"

Zaka highlighted why Crypto must be legalized in Pakistan in a hearing presided over by a 2 member bench of the court headed by Justice KK Agha & Mrs. Kausar Sultana.

Waqar mentioned that the FIA Cyber Crime wing allegedly illegally arrests Crypto miners keeping their Bitcoins worth millions, filing an FIR having that has no sections for Crypto but just based on false claims that State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) has declared crypto illegal, while State Bank’s advocate stated in the court that SBP cannot ban crypto mining as parliament has not given such powers.

He added that Pakistan is at risk of being blacklisted by major marketplaces of digital currencies, as major companies are now backing out from doing business.

Cryptocurrencies are being adopted all over the world as the next step in the financial industry removing the restrictions of borders and creating a free-flowing currency but Pakistan’s stance has been to outright ban it. As the digital age progresses, crypto will become an essential part of the finance industry, and adopting it is necessary if Pakistan is to keep up with the world.

SHANGLA: The Shangla police and the Federal Investigation Agency jointly conducted a raid on a secretly operating digital company in Barkana Shahpur area here, seized the equipment and arrested two persons over involvement in money laundering through the electronic currency bitcoin.

A statement issued by district police officer Malak Ihjaz on Wednesday said the raid was made on a tip-off. He said that after initial interrogation police seized the digital installations and other machines and arrested two suspects.

The statement said that about 84 different types of software were installed in the illegal bitcoin installations, which were supposed to be used for illegal transfer of money to foreign countries.

The DPO said the bitcoin software was a new illegal technique for the illegal money transfers as the government had eliminated all the other unlawful means of money transfer.

According to the statement, the accused were identified as Ghulam Ahmed of Okara and Sajid Sadique Dogar of Lahore, who were handed over to FIA for further interrogation.

DPO Malak Ihjaz, when contacted, told Dawn that on a tip-off he directed sub-divisional police officer, Alpuri, Zahir Khan to conduct a raid, and also informed the FIA officials in this regard.

He said the accused had chosen the remote Shangla area for doing the illegal business to avoid being caught by the law-enforcement officials, but the local police thwarted their bid to carry out unlawful activity.

SHOPS SEALED: Assistant commissioner, Puran, Fazal Wahid, on Wednesday fined several shopkeepers and sealed three outlets for profiteering and hoarding during raids in Nimkaly Bazaar.

He conducted the raids on the directives of deputy commissioner Imran Hussain Ranjha.

He was accompanied by policemen and revenue officials. He warned the shopkeepers and hoteliers against creating artificial price hike. He directed maintaining cleanliness at the restaurants.

ROADS REOPEN TO LIGHT TRAFFIC: The main roads of Shangla were cleared of snow for light traffic on Wednesday.

Bisham-Swat, Karora-Chakesar and Alpuri-Yakhtangay roads were reopened to light traffic. However, link roads in the upper parts remained blocked since the last week’s snowfall.

For a very long time Vanuatu, always the most popular offshore licensing jurisdiction for self-regulated FX/CFD operations, disapproved dealing with Cryptocurrencies in all forms for its VFSC licenses, to the extent that if a small reference to crypto was made on the licensee's website, regardless whether as a means for payment, a traded commodity or a CFD, the license could have been revoked and the 50K$ bond forfeited. Seemingly all of it is about to change.

Tal explains that as of July 22nd, the amendment to the Financial Dealers Licensing Act, without any preliminary announcement, surprisingly went into effect which allows the “distribution, secondary trading, custodial storage and provision of investment advice or other services in relation to digital assets."" This comes after years that any engagement with cryptocurrencies would be restricted and seen as illegal by the regulators in Vanuatu, making anyone who wished to deal with Crypto go other ways.

Tal Ron, Drihem & Co., Law Firm lobbied massively for that change to happen, prepared for the announcement, and built the payments infrastructure 1.5 years in advance to facilitate the needs of those wishing to enrich their services offered and give their business a competitive edge, Genia continues. This amendment placed Vanuatu in the major league, with other, more established, jurisdictions that Tal Ron, Drihem & Co. have already been using since 2017 to represent clients in issuing coins and engage with other Blockchain Blockchain Blockchain comprises a digital network of blocks with a comprehensive ledger of transactions made in a cryptocurrency such as Bitcoin or other altcoins.One of the signature features of blockchain is that it is maintained across more than one computer.

The amendment seeks to expand the possibilities for already-licensed companies in Vanuatu (for which Tal and Genia’s firm are responsible for a large percentage of those), as well as to attract new digital asset companies for which the most important part is to know how to bank them properly and protect their interests while staying fully compliant and socially responsible.

The novelty about the new legislation is not about brokers being able to use Crypto deposits or trade or offer Crypto for themselves or at their business, which is great in itself, but now they are finally able, if play their card right and found adequate, to open a bank account in exceptional brick-and-mortar banks such as Bank Frick in Liechtenstein, which our firm partners with, Genia explains.

Genia discloses that this type of legislation is similar to what they have already dealt with in the past in Gibraltar, one that effectively allows (or does not prevent) crypto-entrepreneurs to launch their own digital currencies. Therefore, Tal’s team has already gathered the knowledge and infrastructure to facilitate the growing demand for Vanuatu companies from all aspects and built a complex network of payment companies accepting the Vanuatu license, thus allowing companies regulated there to issue coins and collect payments, aside of operating FX sites.",Translation Unavailable,8,"[('cryptocurrency', 0.05219771), ('legal', 0.023711251), ('government', 0.02183282), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.01757398), ('ban', 0.01730918), ('market', 0.01691718), ('bitcoins', 0.016005572), ('central', 0.015489987), ('payment', 0.014102425), ('service', 0.014048554)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

Przed weekendem jeden z klientów banku BZ WBK otrzymał oficjalne pismo z oddziału, w którym został poinformowany o rozwiązaniu z nim umowy prowadzenia konta osobistego. Jaki był tego powód? Bank powołał się na zapisy regulaminu, według którego może on wypowiedzieć umowę prowadzenia rachunku w przypadku domniemania przestępstwa – donosi serwis Niebezpiecznik.pl

Po jedenaste: handlować bitcoinami nie będziesz

Owym przestępstwem, określonym w dokumencie jako niezgodność z prawem był handel kryptowalutą Bitcoin. Dyrektor oddziału banku z Nowego Sącza uważa, że skoro nie ma ani regulacji, ani rekomendacji Komisji Nadzoru Finansowego – obrót kryptowalutami jest niezgodny z prawem. Skontaktowaliśmy się z BZ WBK, ale bank odmawia na razie komentarza.

Podobną niespodziankę zorganizował swojemu klientowi Bank BPH. Na portalu zajmującym się sprzedażą domen i obrotem kryptowalutami – BitMarket.pl pojawiło się wczoraj oświadczenie o zablokowaniu ich rachunków rozliczeniowych prowadzonych przez BPH. Pracownik po zalogowaniu do bankowości internetowej zobaczył jedynie pustkę, ponieważ zniknęły wszystkie ich konta oraz zdeponowane na nich pieniądze. Gdy spółka próbowała wyjaśnić sprawę, bank zwodził ich kilkoma różnymi wersjami – najpierw tłumaczył sprawę chwilowymi problemami technicznymi, potem motywował swoją decyzję rzekomym debetem na kontach. Dopiero dział prawny poinformował bez ogródek, że konta zostały zamknięte z powodu obrotu bitcoinami.

Sprawa jest o tyle trudna, że Bank nie poinformował firmy z wyprzedzeniem. W efekcie jej klienci nie mają obecnie możliwości dokonywania wpłat w związku z inwestowaniem w wirtualną walutę. Od Banku BPH również nie udało nam się jeszcze otrzymać komentarza. Bank ma odnieść się do tej sprawy jeszcze w dniu dzisiejszym.

After eleventh: you won't be able to trade bitcoins

Bitcoin cryptocurrency trading was the crime specified in the document as the law.The director of the Bank branch from Nowy Sącz believes that since there is neither regulations nor the recommendation of the Polish Financial Supervision Authority - the rotation of cryptocurrencies is unlawful.We contacted BZ WBK, but the bank refuses to comment.

Bank BPH organized a similar surprise to his client.On the portal dealing in the sale of domains and cryptocurrency trading - bitmarket.pl yesterday a statement appeared on blocking their billing accounts kept by BPH.After logging in to online banking, the employee only saw the void, because all their accounts and money deposited on them disappeared.When the company tried to clarify the matter, the bank deceived them with several different versions - first it explained the matter with temporary technical problems, then motivated its decision with alleged debit on accounts.Only the legal department informed the blush that the accounts were closed due to the trading of bitcoins.

The matter is difficult because the bank did not inform the company in advance.As a result, her customers are currently not able to make payments in connection with investing in virtual currency.We have not been able to receive a comment from Bank BPH.The bank is to refer to this matter today.

- Nie stoimy na przeszkodzie rozwojowi bitcoina. Jednak oczekujemy od jego użytkowników deklaracji, czy oczekują od państwa ochrony i regulacji, czy pozostania państwa z boku – powiedział Szymon Woźniak.



Jak stwierdził, Ministerstwo Finansów nie może obecnie uznać bitcoina za środek płatniczy i oczekuje na stanowisko w tej sprawie innych krajów Unii Europejskiej. Jak oblicza dr Krzysztof Piech z Zakładu Polityki Gospodarczej SGH, Polska znajduje się na dziesiątym miejscu pod względem liczby wykopywanych bitcoinów, a polski rynek bitcoinowy znajduje się w światowej czołówce.

The news comes as a shock as Qatar has was seen as a leader in terms of blockchain adoption in the region. Now, government officials are voicing concerns over money laundering and terrorist financing as a means to stifle local crypto activities.

News of the crypto ban came via a report by the Qatar Financial Centre Regulatory Authority (QFCRA). In the now-infamous report, the QFCRA stated that all services involving cryptocurrencies are now illegal within the exclusive economic zone. Specifically listed in the report are critical components to the market. These components include crypto to crypto trades and crypto to fiat exchanges. Also, the report directly lists virtual asset services including those that facilitate the trading, custody, and issuance of virtual assets in any form or manner.

Security Tokens Safe

Interestingly, the report doesn’t ban security tokens. In fact, these unique financial instruments remain unaffected by the new legislation. The report states that financial instruments regulated by the QFCRA, the Qatar Central Bank, or the Qatar Financial Markets Authority are exempt from the ban. This makes sense from Qatar’s standpoint because these tokens undergo full AML and KYC verification.

Discussing the decision, Sheikh Abdulla bin Saoud Al-Thani, the governor of Qatar’s Central Bank pointed to a few key points as to why the regulations make sense. He stated that a correlated effort needed to be put forth to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. He believes that only a stricter and effective regulatory and legislative framework can accomplish this task.

It appears as if this latest maneuver is actually just a part of Qatar’s overall new approach towards combating money laundering. Recently, the country instituted wide-sweeping AML legislation. All of these laws seek to curb those attempting to hide money from the government.

The Qatar Financial Centre – QFC

The QFC is a special jurisdiction within the country designed to spur economic growth. Companies that call the QFC home get access to a host of exclusive benefits. These benefits include reduced legal, business, tax, and regulatory infrastructure. In this way, Qatar seeks to attract businesses and facilitate economic development moving forward.

Tighter Regulations Globally

Qatar’s decision to add more regulations to the crypto sector mirrors that of numerous other countries. Just recently, US lawmakers proposed new legislation to bring much of the crypto market under the jurisdiction of regulators. If the new bills receive approval, there would be wide-sweeping implications for the industry.

Additionally, EU Lawmakers have come up with new legislation as well. On January 10th, 2020, the European Union (EU) will initiate the Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (5AMLD). This new law requires that all digital asset platforms and even wallet providers verify and record customer identities.

Qatar Steps Backwards

As Qatar attempts to gain more control over the use and trading of digital assets within its border, it may find that these new regulations have an adverse effect. Cryptocurrencies, many of which are designed to function anonymously, are not so easily regulated and monitored. For now, Qatar will see exactly what it takes to police the digital realm as they start the enforcement of their new crypto legislation.","In a surprising turn of events, The Qatar Financial Centre (QFC) announced that it would ban all cryptocurrency-related activities including cryptocurrency exchanges within the sector.

The central bank will impose penalties in accordance with the provisions of the Qatar Central Bank law and regulation of financial institutions issued by Law No. (13) for the year 2012 in the event of any violation of this circular.

În paralel, procurorii DIICOT au găsit, acasă la hacker suma de 100.000 de euro, despre care acesta susține că a obținut-o după ce a tranzacționat mai multe monede de tip BIOTCOIN.

Avocata Maria Mladin, care îl apără pe hackerul în fața judecătorilor, susține că procurorii DIICOT au deschis un dosar separat pentru această tranzacție, acuzația adusă fiind de spălare de bani, totodată fiind dispus și sechestrul asupra sumei de 100.000 de euro.

Deși procurorii au obligația legală de a aduna probe în favoarea și în defavoarea inculpatului, nu au făcut niciun demers pentru a afla acest lucru. ”Clientul meu a făcut proba că tranzacția cu monede BITCOIN a existat. A depus acte care atestă această tranzacație. Nu poatre fi vorba despre infracțiunea de spălare de bani, din moment ce Statul Român nu este vătămat deoarece nu are cadrul legal să impoziteze aceste tranzacții. Dosarul este deschis de mai mulți ani și nimeni nu mai face nimic în el”, spune Maria Mladin.

Răspunsul de la fisc: BITCOIN nu se impozitează

Maria Mladin a reușit să demonstreze faptul că în cazul în care este angajată nu este vorba despre o infracțiune ci despre o tranzacție financiară, care a scăpat de brașul lung al Fiscului. Surpriza a venit în moment în care ea a cerut Ministerului de Finanțe un răspuns pentru a lămuri întreaga problemă. ”Instituțiile Băncii Naționale a României și Autorității de Supraveghere Financiară nu consideră că moneda virutală BITCOIN reprezintă monedă electronică sau instrument financiar și nu se poate evidenția un regim fiscal potrivit actualului cadru juridic reglementat. La momentul actual, regimul monedei BITCOIN nu este reglementat legislativ și considerăm că numai după crearea cadrului legal, se va analiza necesitatea reglementării în plan fiscal a acestei probleme”, se arată în răspunsul Ministerului de Finanțe.

Avocata Mladin susține că sunt foarte mulți tineri, în marea lor majoritate IT-iști, care dețin mai multe astfel de monede, care în prezent au ajuns să coste 5.000 de dolari/bucată. ”Acum, vom depune acest răspuns la dosar și sperăm ca procurorii DIICOT Cluj să îl dea o soluție, favorabilă clientului meu”, mai spune avocata Mladin.","The whole story started from a hacker who was preventively arrested for six months, because he would have tried to access more sites including the SRI or the Presidency of Romania.In parallel, DIICOT prosecutors found at home at Hacker the sum of 100,000 euros, which he claims to have obtained after trading several biotcoin coins.

The lawyer Maria Mladin, who defends the hacker in front of the judges, argues that the DIICOT prosecutors have opened a separate file for this transaction, the accusation brought by money laundering, at the same time being ordered on the amount of 100,000 euros.

Although the prosecutors have the legal obligation to gather evidence in favor and at the expense of the defendant, they did not take any action to find out.""My client did the proof that the Bitcoin coin transaction existed.Submitted documents attesting this transaction.It can not be about the offense of money laundering, since the Romanian state is not injured because it does not have the legal framework to tax these transactions.The file has been open for several years and no one does anything in it, ”says Maria Mladin.

Fiscin response: Bitcoin is not taxed

Maria Mladin managed to demonstrate that if she is employed, it is not a crime but a financial transaction, which escaped the long fiscal.The surprise came when she asked the Ministry of Finance to explain the whole problem.""The institutions of the National Bank of Romania and the Financial Supervisory Authority do not consider that the Bitcoin virus currency represent electronic currency or financial instrument and a fiscal regime cannot be highlighted according to the current regulated legal framework.At present, the regime of the Bitcoin currency is not legislatively regulated and we consider that only after the legal framework, will the need to regulate this problem be analyzed, ”the Ministry of Finance is stated.

The lawyer Mladin claims that there are many young people, mostly IT-I, who have several such coins, which have now come to cost $ 5,000/piece.""Now, we will submit this answer to the file and hope that the prosecutors DIICOT Cluj will give it a solution, favorable to my client,"" says lawyer Mladin.",1,"[('cryptocurrency', 0.039894804), ('financial', 0.03495469), ('2018', 0.020681204), ('exchange', 0.0182124), ('transaction', 0.017677767), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.017443212), ('trading', 0.01689826), ('ban', 0.015825065), ('payment', 0.014948157), ('regulation', 0.012330683)]",1,"[('use', 0.035869658), ('translation', 0.022106161), ('unavailable', 0.02210551), ('digital', 0.02120728), ('permission', 0.018492848), ('right', 0.017274445), ('bitcoin', 0.017273907), ('also', 0.017009981), ('law', 0.016546033), ('currency', 0.016354725)]"

În contextul utilizării unor scheme de monedă virtuală (Bitcoin și altele), Banca Națională a României face următoarele precizări cu privire la riscurile asociate acestora.

Moneda virtuală nu este monedă națională și nici valută, iar acceptarea acesteia la plată nu este obligatorie din punct de vedere legal. Totodată, moneda virtuală nu reprezintă o formă de monedă electronică, în înțelesul Legii nr. 127/2011 privind activitatea de emitere de monedă electronică.

Utilizarea schemelor de monedă virtuală ca modalitate alternativă de plată prezintă potențiale riscuri pentru sistemul financiar legate de lipsa reglementării și a supravegherii, spălarea banilor, finanțarea terorismului, volatilitatea prețului și lipsa unei securități adecvate, potrivit unui raport elaborat recent de către Banca Centrală Europeană (http://www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualcurrencyschemesen.pdf).

De asemenea, Autoritatea Bancară Europeană a avertizat consumatorii cu privire la riscurile asociate cumpărării, deținerii și tranzacționării monedelor virtuale și, ulterior, a emis o opinie referitoare la schemele de monedă virtuală.

In the context of using virtual currency schemes (Bitcoin and others), the National Bank of Romania makes the following details regarding the risks associated with them.

The virtual currency is no national currency and no currency, and its acceptance for payment is not legally compulsory.At the same time, the virtual currency does not represent a form of electronic currency, within the meaning of Law no.127/2011 regarding the activity of issuing electronic currency.

The use of virtual currency schemes as an alternative payment method presents potential risks to the financial system related to the lack of regulation and supervision, money laundering, terrorist financing, price volatility and lack of adequate security, according to a recent report by the European Central Bank (HTTP: //www.ecb.europa.eu/pub/pdf/other/virtualCurrencyschemesen.pdf).

Also, the European Banking Authority has warned consumers about the risks associated with buying, holding and trading virtual currencies and subsequently issued an opinion on the virtual currency schemes.(The documents can be found at https://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/598420/ eba_2013_01030000_ro_tra.pdf and http://www.eba.europa.eu/documents/10180/657547/eba-2014-08+opinion+on+virtual+currencies.pdf).

(2) c), specifying that the income tax of 10% is only applied on the ""positive difference between the selling price and acquisition price"" (and not to the entire received amount from a sale). In addition, profits under 200 RON per transaction that total under 600 RON during a fiscal year are exempt from tax.[142]",142,cite_note-142,https://static.anaf.ro/static/10/Anaf/legislatie/Cod_fiscal_norme_30012019.htm#A116,['19 February 2019'],142,"Legea nr. 227/2015 privind Codul fiscal

În cazul în care se efectuează reevaluări ale imobilizărilor necorporale care determină o descreștere a valorii acestora sub valoarea rămasă neamortizată stabilită în baza valorii de înregistrare în patrimoniu, valoarea fiscală rămasă neamortizată a imobilizărilor necorporale se recalculează până la nivelul celei stabilite pe baza valorii de înregistrare în patrimoniu;

b) În cazul în care se trece de la modelul reevaluării la modelul bazat pe cost, în valoarea fiscală a activelor și pasivelor stabilită potrivit regulilor prevăzute la pct. 44, cu excepția mijloacelor fixe amortizabile și a terenurilor, nu se include actualizarea cu rata inflației;

c) În cazul în care se trece de la modelul reevaluării la modelul bazat pe cost, din valoarea fiscală a mijloacelor fixe amortizabile și a terenurilor se scad reevaluările efectuate potrivit reglementărilor contabile și se include actualizarea cu rata inflației;

d) pentru proprietățile imobiliare clasificate ca investiții imobiliare, valoarea fiscală este reprezentată de costul de achiziție, de producție sau de valoarea de piață a investițiilor imobiliare dobândite cu titlu gratuit ori constituite ca aport la data intrării în patrimoniul contribuabilului, utilizată pentru calculul amortizării fiscale, după caz. În valoarea fiscală se includ și evaluările efectuate potrivit reglementărilor contabile.

e) pentru mijloacele fixe amortizabile clasificate ca active biologice, valoarea fiscală este reprezentată de costul de achiziție, de producție sau de valoarea de piață în cazul celor dobândite cu titlu gratuit ori constituite ca aport la data intrării în patrimoniul contribuabilului, după caz, utilizată pentru calculul amortizării fiscale. În valoarea fiscală se includ și evaluările efectuate potrivit reglementărilor contabile. În cazul în care se efectuează evaluări ale activelor biologice care determină o descreștere a valorii acestora sub valoarea rămasă neamortizată stabilită în baza costului de achiziție/producție sau valorii de piață în cazul celor dobândite cu titlu gratuit ori constituite ca aport, valoarea fiscală rămasă neamortizată a activelor biologice se recalculează până la nivelul celei stabilite pe baza costului de achiziție/producție sau a valorii de piață, după caz;

ACTE NORMATIVE

(2) Tranzacțiile transfrontaliere sau o serie de tranzacții transfrontaliere care sunt calificate ca fiind artificiale de organele fiscale competente nu vor face parte din domeniul de aplicare a convențiilor de evitare a dublei impuneri.

(3) Prin tranzacții transfrontaliere artificiale se înțelege tranzacțiile transfrontaliere sau seriile de tranzacții transfrontaliere care nu au un conținut economic și care nu pot fi utilizate în mod normal în cadrul unor practici economice obișnuite, scopul esențial al acestora fiind acela de a evita impozitarea ori de a obține avantaje fiscale care altfel nu ar putea fi acordate. Tranzacțiile transfrontaliere sau seriile de tranzacții transfrontaliere sunt acele tranzacții efectuate între două sau mai multe persoane dintre care cel puțin una se află în afara României.

(4) Tranzacțiile între persoane afiliate se realizează conform principiului valorii de piață. În cadrul unei tranzacții, al unui grup de tranzacții între persoane afiliate, organele fiscale pot ajusta, în cazul în care principiul valorii de piață nu este respectat, sau pot estima, în cazul în care contribuabilul nu pune la dispoziția organului fiscal competent datele necesare pentru a stabili dacă prețurile de transfer practicate în situația analizată respectă principiul valorii de piață, suma venitului sau a cheltuielii aferente rezultatului fiscal oricăreia dintre părțile afiliate pe baza nivelului tendinței centrale a pieței. Procedura de ajustare/estimare și modalitatea de stabilire a nivelului tendinței centrale a pieței, precum și situațiile în care autoritatea fiscală poate considera că un contribuabil nu a furnizat datele necesare stabilirii respectării principiului pentru tranzacțiile analizate se stabilesc potrivit Codului de procedură fiscală. La stabilirea valorii de piață a tranzacțiilor desfășurate între persoane afiliate se folosește metoda cea mai adecvată dintre următoarele:

a) metoda comparării prețurilor;

b) metoda cost plus;

c) metoda prețului de revânzare;

d) metoda marjei nete;

e) metoda împărțirii profitului;

f) orice altă metodă recunoscută în Liniile directoare privind prețurile de transfer emise de către Organizația pentru Cooperare și Dezvoltare Economică pentru societățile multinaționale și administrațiile fiscale, cu amendamentele/modificările și completările ulterioare.

Organele fiscale competente au dreptul de a anula TVA dedusă în legătură cu fiecare tranzacție ori de câte ori se constată că dreptul de deducere a fost exercitat în mod abuziv. Pentru a invoca abuzul de drept, trebuie să fie îndeplinite cumulativ două condiții:

a) tranzacțiile în cauză, în pofida aplicării formale a condițiilor prevăzute de dispozițiile legale, au drept rezultat garantarea unor avantaje fiscale care ar contraveni scopului acelor dispoziții legale;

b) trebuie dovedit, în mod obiectiv, faptul că scopul esențial al operațiunilor în cauză este de a se obține un avantaj fiscal.

(13) Procedura de aplicare a prevederilor alin. (1) se stabilește prin ordin al președintelui A.N.A.F.

“That, in all likelihood, is not legal now, is, of course, the use of cryptocurrencies in the calculations,” Moiseev said, clarifying that we are talking about calculations in Russia.

The deputy head of the Ministry of Finance also noted that due to legal vacuum it is impossible to say exactly whether the work of cryptocurrency exchanges in the Russian Federation is legal now.“Obviously, it’s now a legal vacuum, and, accordingly, these actions are legal or not, it’s hard for me to say,” Moiseev explained.

In August, the entrepreneur German Sterligov announced the creation of offline exchanges in August, there are also online foreigners.In addition, several cafes and a company for the sale of real estate declared the use of cryptocurrencies in calculations with customers.At the moment, the legal status of cryptocurrencies in Russia is not defined.

Банк России отмечает, что в последнее время резко возросло количество запросов участников финансового рынка и СМИ по поводу криптовалют, получивших широкое распространение в мире.

Совместно с заинтересованными федеральными органами государственной власти Банк России осуществляет мониторинг рынка криптовалют и вырабатывает подходы к определению и регулированию криптовалют в Российской Федерации.

Большинство операций с криптовалютами совершается вне правового регулирования как Российской Федерации, так и большинства других государств. Криптовалюты не гарантируются и не обеспечиваются Банком России.

Криптовалюты выпускаются неограниченным кругом анонимных субъектов. В силу анонимного характера деятельности по выпуску криптовалют граждане и юридические лица могут быть вовлечены в противоправную деятельность, включая легализацию (отмывание) доходов, полученных преступным путем, и финансирование терроризма.

Операции с криптовалютами несут в себе высокие риски как при проведении обменных операций, в том числе из-за резких колебаний обменного курса, так и в случае привлечения финансирования через ICO (Initial Coin Offering — форма привлечения инвестиций граждан в виде выпуска и продажи инвесторам новых криптовалют/токенов). Существуют также технологические риски при выпуске и обращении криптовалют и риски фиксации прав на «виртуальные валюты». Это может привести к финансовым потерям граждан и к невозможности защиты прав потребителей финансовых услуг в случае их нарушения.

Учитывая высокие риски обращения и использования криптовалют, Банк России считает преждевременным допуск криптовалют, а также любых финансовых инструментов, номинированных или связанных с криптовалютами, к обращению и использованию на организованных торгах и в расчетно-клиринговой инфраструктуре на территории Российской Федерации для обслуживания сделок с криптовалютами и производными финансовыми инструментами на них.

В связи с этим Банк России обращает внимание граждан и всех участников финансового рынка на повышенные риски при использовании и инвестировании в криптовалюты.

The Bank of Russia notes that recently the number of requests for participants in the financial market and the media about cryptocurrencies that have become widespread in the world has sharply increased.

Together with the interested federal government bodies, the Bank of Russia monitors the cryptocurrency market and develops approaches to the determination and regulation of cryptocurrencies in the Russian Federation.

Most transactions with cryptocurrencies are performed outside the legal regulation of both the Russian Federation and most other states.Cryptocurrencies are not guaranteed and are not provided by the Bank of Russia.

Cryptocurrencies are produced by an unlimited circle of anonymous entities.By virtue of the anonymous nature of the release of cryptocurrencies, citizens and legal entities can be involved in unlawful activities, including the legalization (laundering) of income received by criminal means, and financing of terrorism.

Operations with cryptocurrencies carry high risks both during metabolic operations, including due to sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate, and in the case of attracting funding through ICO (Initial Coin Offering-a form of attracting citizens' investments in the form of release and selling new cryptocurrencies to investors/tokens).There are also technological risks in the release and appeal of cryptocurrencies and risks of fixing rights to “virtual currencies”.This can lead to financial losses of citizens and to the impossibility of protecting the rights of consumers of financial services in case of violation.

Given the high risks of the circulation and use of cryptocurrencies, the Bank of Russia considers it premature to allow cryptocurrencies, as well as any financial instruments nominated or related to cryptocurrencies, to the circulation and use of organized tenders and in calculating-valiant infrastructure in the territory of the Russian Federation to serve transactions with cryptocurrencies andderivatives of financial instruments on them.

In this regard, the Bank of Russia draws the attention of citizens and all participants in the financial market for increased risks when using and investing in cryptocurrencies.

SINGAPORE - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is cautioning consumers against bitcoin trading even as a few merchants in Singapore have started accepting the digital currency as payment for physical goods.

SINGAPORE - The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) is cautioning consumers against bitcoin trading even as a few merchants in Singapore have started accepting the digital currency as payment for physical goods.

Such activities are not regulated and supervised by the National Bank of Slovakia or the European Central Bank. At the same time NBS points out that any legal person or natural person in the Slovak Republic shall not issue any notes or any other coins. Unlawful manufacturing of banknotes and coins and putting them into circulation is punishable by law. In this context, NBS points out that virtual currencies have not a physical counterpart in the form of legal tender and participation in such a scheme (virtual currency) is at your own risk.

193,South Korea,Legal, Minors and all foreigners are prohibited from trading cryptocurrencies. Adult South Koreans may trade on registered exchanges using real name accounts at a bank where the exchange also has an account.  Both the bank and the exchange are responsible for verifying the customer's identity and enforcing other anti-money-laundering provisions.[108][109],109,cite_note-109,https://thenews.asia/amendment-to-special-reporting-act-passes-cryptocurrency-trading-now-legal-in-south-korea/,['5 March 2020'],109,"The amendment to the Act on Reporting and Use of Specific Financial Information passed this afternoon in a full session of National Assembly. The passing of the amendment signifies the official entry of cryptocurrency trading and holding into the legal system for the South Korean government. A restructuring of the domestic blockchain industry is expected to take place as a result of this event.

One of the main caveats to the enactment of the amendment is that cryptocurrency exchanges will need to comply with reporting requirements. Although the larger exchanges mostly comply with the new rules already, small and medium-sized exchanges may have trouble obtaining the contracts to reach full compliance.

President Jaein Moon must sign the amendment into law to start the enactment process which will be one year from the date of signing followed by a 6-month grace period. This means that all entities affected by the law will need to be in full compliance by September 2021. The passing of the amendment comes after a lengthy 2-year process of deliberations and trial and error of recommended guidelines but few official laws. Exchanges and companies handling cryptocurrency up to this point have been mostly self-governing in regard to their cryptocurrency, but have run into trouble with how the cryptos are turned into fiat currency.

Exchanges, trusts, wallet companies, and ICO are now required by law to have a real-name verification partnership with an approved Korean bank. Real-name accounts prevent money laundering by assigning a verified individual to a single bank account with which they may withdraw and deposit fiat currency from and to an exchange. Also, companies must obtain an information security management system (ISMS) certification.

Some exchanges already have the real-name verification system on their platform as it was imposed via guidelines set by the FSC in early 2018. The ISMS certification system is granted by the Korea Internet Security Agency (KISA) which certifies that a company can secure key information assets for itself and its users. This certification can be very costly, but all exchanges must comply within 6 months of its enactment or risk being shut down.

The measures imposed by the law will ensure stricter AML and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT) compliance by exchanges mainly.

Up until now, anyone could launch a cryptocurrency exchange in South Korea. By September 2019, there were over 70 exchanges in the country. The saturation of the market has led to a bevy of problems for consumers in the industry. Many have suffered fraud ranging from exit scams and false trading volumes to insider trading and blatant manipulation of the value of some coins.

Local Korean cryptocurrency investors have mixed feelings about the introduction of the new law into the system. Some have applauded the measures proclaiming that a ‘New Coin Age‘ has begun in Korea. Others further noted that “[[cryptocurrency] is nationally recognized as gambling no more.]”

On the other hand, cynical investors have pointed out the futility of such measures. While the security of investors’ assets is objectively increased by these measures, one points out that despite the added security, investors will still lose their money because they will have to pay taxes on their trades. Furthermore, another investor on Coinpan begs the community to see how poorly the stock market is performing with all of its regulations these days – “[with all the new regulations to the cryptocurrency industry, a massive cooldown of the values of cryptos will ensue.]”

There is a concern that investors will suffer further damages as perhaps their preferred exchange closes, charges higher fees, or requires more documentation to continue trading on the platform. By the end of the 6-month grace period, crypto traders in Korea may actually only have 4 to 6 exchanges to choose from since only Upbit, Bithumb, Coinone, and Korbit have the real-name banking system and the previous 4 plus 2 others, GoPax and Hanbitco are utilizing ISMS.

Investors have suffered greatly by the ‘wild west’ regulatory landscape of the cryptocurrency trading industry in Korea in the past few years. Numerous accusations and some guilty verdicts of fraud have been doled out. Upbit has been in the middle of fraud accusations for years, as has Bithumb, BOSCoin, Komid, and Newbit, among others. In response to the attempt to rectify the wrongs of the past, Hanbitco CEO Sunga Kim commented, “A foundation has been created to wash away the stigma of cryptocurrency exchanges, fraud, and debauchery and establish itself as a transparent and reliable industry. It will lead the development of the industry with the inflow of new capital.”

Pojasnilo DURS, št. 4210-11634/2013, 23. 12. 2013



Davčna uprava Republike Slovenije (v nadaljevanju: DURS) je prejela vprašanja davčnih zavezancev, ki se nanašajo na davčno obravnavo poslovanja z bitcoin virtualno valuto.



Ker davčna zakonodaja ne vsebuje posebnih določb, ki bi urejale davčno ureditev poslovanja z virtualnimi valutami, smo z navedeno problematiko seznanili Ministrstvo za finance in zaprosili za njihovo mnenje.



Pojasnilo Ministrstva za finance, ki se nanaša tudi na davčno obravnavo tovrstnega poslovanja po Zakonu o davku od dohodkov pravnih oseb, povzemamo v nadaljevanju.



»Bitcoin virtualna valuta se ne šteje za denarno sredstvo v smislu 7. točke 4. člena Zakona o plačilnih storitvah in sistemih (Uradni list RS, št. 58/09, 34/10, 9/11 in 32/12). Prav tako se bitcoin ne šteje za finančni instrument.



Davčna obravnava dohodka, doseženega pri takem trgovanju/poslovanju ali v taki obliki, je odvisna od okoliščin posameznega primera. Tako je treba ugotoviti, kdo dosega dohodek in za kakšne vrste dohodek v posameznem primeru gre (dohodek iz kreiranja bitcoinov, iz kupovanja in prodajanja bitcoinov, izplačilo drugega dohodka v bitcoinih).



Po Zakonu o dohodnini (Uradni list RS, št. 13/11-UPB7, 24/12, 30/12, 40/12-ZUJF, 75/12, 94/12 in 96/13; v nadaljevanju: ZDoh-2) je treba ločiti dva primera:



a) Dohodek dosega fizična oseba



Po 15. členu ZDoh-2 se obdavčujejo dohodki fizične osebe, ki so bili pridobljeni oziroma doseženi v davčnem letu, ki je enako koledarskemu letu. Dohodki so vsi dohodki in dobički, ne glede na vrsto, če ni s tem zakonom drugače določeno. Za dohodek se šteje vsako izplačilo oziroma prejem dohodka, ne glede na obliko, v kateri je izplačan oziroma prejet. Dohodek, prejet v naravi, se določi na podlagi primerljive tržne cene, če ni z zakonom drugače določeno. Dohodek je pridobljen oziroma dosežen v davčnem letu, v katerem je prejet, če ni s tem zakonom drugače določeno. Šteje se, da je dohodek prejet, ko je izplačan fizični osebi ali je kako drugače dan na razpolago fizični osebi.



Skladno z navedenim se kakršen koli dohodek, ki je obdavčljiv po ZDoh-2 (npr. plačilo za opravljeno storitev svetovanja), a ga fizična oseba ne doseže v evrih, temveč v bitcoinih, obdavči kot tovrstni dohodek, prejet v naravi. Višina dohodka v evrih se določi upoštevaje vrednost bitcoina v evrih v času, ko je dohodek prejet.

V 1. točki 32. člena ZDoh-2 je določeno, da se dohodnine ne plača od dobička iz kapitala od odsvojitve premičnin, razen premičnin iz 2. in 3. točke 93. člena tega zakona, in od odsvojitve izvedenih finančnih instrumentov, razen dobička iz kapitala delojemalca, ki odsvoji pravico do nakupa delnic ali pravico do pridobitve drugega premoženja; navedena določba ne vpliva na davčno obveznost fizične osebe, ki opravlja dejavnost po III.3. poglavju tega zakona. Skladno z navedenim se od dobička iz kapitala, ki ga fizična oseba dosega s prodajanjem bitcoinov, ne plača dohodnina.

Dohodek, ki ga fizična oseba dosega v obliki bitcoinov pri kreiranju oz. »rudarjenju«, se obdavči kot drugi dohodek po 105. členu ZDoh-2. Višina dohodka v evrih se določi upoštevaje vrednost bitcoina v evrih v času, ko je dohodek prejet.

b) Dohodek dosega fizična oseba v okviru opravljanja dejavnosti



Za dohodek iz dejavnosti po poglavju III.3. ZDoh-2 se skladno s 46. členom ZDoh-2 šteje dohodek, dosežen z neodvisnim samostojnim opravljanjem dejavnosti, ne glede na namen in rezultat opravljanja dejavnosti. Opravljanje dejavnosti pomeni opravljanje vsake podjetniške, kmetijske ali gozdarske dejavnosti, poklicne dejavnosti ali druge neodvisne samostojne dejavnosti, vključno z izkoriščanjem premoženja in premoženjskih pravic.



Po prvem odstavku 48. člena ZDoh-2 je davčna osnova od dohodka iz dejavnosti dobiček, ki se ugotovi kot razlika med prihodki in odhodki, doseženimi v zvezi z opravljanjem dejavnosti, če ni s tem zakonom drugače določeno. Po drugem odstavku se za ugotavljanje prihodkov in odhodkov uporabljajo predpisi o obdavčitvi dohodkov pravnih oseb, če ni s tem zakonom drugače določeno. Več o obdavčitvi pravnih oseb je opisano v nadaljevanju.



Dobiček iz poslov trgovanja z bitcoini ali dohodek iz »rudarjenja«, ki ga fizična oseba dosega v okviru opravljanja dejavnosti iz poglavja III.3. ZDoh-2, se torej obdavčuje kot dohodek iz dejavnosti po določbah ZDoh-2.



Po Zakonu o davku od dohodkov pravnih oseb (Uradni list RS, št. 117/06, 56/08, 76/08, 5/09, 96/09, 110/09 – ZDavP-2B, 43/10, 59/11, 24/12, 30/12, 94/12 in 81/13; v nadaljevanju: ZDDPO-2) je davčna osnova za davek rezidenta in nerezidenta za dejavnost oziroma posle v poslovni enoti ali preko poslovne enote v Sloveniji, dobiček, ki se ugotovi v skladu z določbami ZDDPO-2 (prvi odstavek 12. člena). V 12. členu ZDDPO-2 je nadalje določeno, da je dobiček presežek prihodkov nad odhodki, ki so določeni s tem zakonom. Če ZDDPO-2 ne določa drugače, se za ugotavljanje dobička priznajo prihodki in odhodki, ugotovljeni v izkazu poslovnega izida oziroma letnem poročilu, ki ustreza izkazu poslovnega izida in prikazuje prihodke, odhodke in poslovni izid, na podlagi zakona in v skladu z njim uvedenimi računovodskimi standardi.



Navedeno je splošna določba glede ugotavljanja oziroma določanja davčne osnove po ZDDPO-2, ki se uporablja, če ni za posamezni dohodek posebne ureditve.



Ugotavljamo, da veljavni ZDDPO-2 nima konkretne oziroma izrecne določbe za davčno obravnavo dohodkov, povezanih s poslovanjem/trgovanjem z bitcoini.



Glede na navedeno so za določanje davčne obravnave merodajna pravila za računovodenje, konkretno, za določanje davčne osnove se priznavajo prihodki in odhodki, ugotovljeni v izkazu poslovnega izda.



Z vidika davčne pristojnosti ugotavljamo, da je računovodska obravnava pri opisanem trgovanju/poslovanju ali v taki obliki, odvisna od okoliščin posameznega primera.«

Zug's mayor, Dolfi Müller, was surprised by the considerable media response. The city council was simply looking for a creative way to grease Zug's economy, ""With Bitcoin, we're sending a message: We in Zug want to get out in front of future technologies,"" he told DW.

The council only realized in hindsight that their decision would make history. Zug is the first locality in the world to accept the digital currency. It's a humble start; payments are limited to the equivalent of 200 Swiss francs. Müller wanted to keep risk low while Zug tests the waters, he's aware of the controversy surrounding Bitcoin.

Some argue the digital currency isn't secure enough for civilian use. Bitcoin's market price is volatile and scammers are still all too common. To mitigate this insecurity, all Bitcoin payments in Zug are immediately converted into the Swiss currency. ""That's what the stock exchange is for,"" says Müller, ""it saves us from losing huge amounts in nanoseconds.""

Zug is a picturesque Swiss town complete with a lake and panoramic views of the Alps. The taxes are low, but rent is through the roof. The population is international. Maybe that's why Bitcoin enjoys near universal approval among Zug's residents. There were few complaints as to the opacity of the origins of Bitcoins.

On the contrary, many people find Bitcoin transactions refreshing because they cut out a middleman - the banks. One woman is organizing a project to castrate stray cats on the island of Santorini. To expect to receive large donations for this project is naïve, she says. Instead, she's turning to micro-finance, which Bitcoin is perfect for because it skirts banks fees.

Bitcoins at the dentist

However, Bitcoin still hasn't found its way into day-to-day transactions. Hotels, stores and restaurants don't accept the currency. Abbas Hussain-Probst is the exception. The dentist offers his patients the opportunity to rid themselves of toothache with Bitcoins instead of francs.

But according to the dentist, public trust in Bitcoin is still low. Only a handful of his patients have paid with Bitcoin in the past year, and all of them work in IT. Of course, these are the people Zug's city council had in mind when they began accepting the digital currency.

Moving toward a 'Crypto Valley'

About 20 fintech companies have recently settled in Zug and neighboring Baar, including Bitcoin Suisse. The company has servers up in the Alps that run highly complex mathematical functions to mine new Bitcoins.

To help popularize Bitcoins, the company also runs a number of Bitcoin-ATMs. One stands in Kafi Schoffel, a restaurant in Zürich. In exchange for francs or euros, the machine spits out a nondescript strip of paper with a QR code on it. This code, when scanned by a smartphone, can be used as payment. Kafi Schoffel customers use them to buy cappuccinos.

Niklas Nikolajsen, CEO of Bitcoin Suisse, predicts it will still take a number of years before digital currencies enjoy widespread use. But he's sure the day will come when everyone buys their cappuccinos with Bitcoins. Nikolajsen says digital currencies reduce barriers to the global economy, ""A taxidriver in Nairobi might be unable to accept credit cards because of high fees, but all he has to do is buy a five-dollar smartphone to accept Bitcoins.""","The town of Zug in Switzerland wants to become the center of a Swiss ""Crypto Valley."" Residents can now pay their fees in Bitcoin, and Fintech companies in the region are closely watching this experiment.

Zug's mayor, Dolfi Müller, was surprised by the considerable media response. The city council was simply looking for a creative way to grease Zug's economy, ""With Bitcoin, we're sending a message: We in Zug want to get out in front of future technologies,"" he told DW.

The council only realized in hindsight that their decision would make history. Zug is the first locality in the world to accept the digital currency. It's a humble start; payments are limited to the equivalent of 200 Swiss francs. Müller wanted to keep risk low while Zug tests the waters, he's aware of the controversy surrounding Bitcoin.

Some argue the digital currency isn't secure enough for civilian use. Bitcoin's market price is volatile and scammers are still all too common. To mitigate this insecurity, all Bitcoin payments in Zug are immediately converted into the Swiss currency. ""That's what the stock exchange is for,"" says Müller, ""it saves us from losing huge amounts in nanoseconds.""

Tseng Ming-chung’s statement was reported yesterday by the Central News Agency (link via Google Translate), Taiwan’s state-run news service.

TechCrunch’s John Biggs reported earlier this week that U.S.-based company Robocoin plans to bring its Bitcoin ATMs to Taiwan and Hong Kong as part of its global expansion plans. Robocoin CEO Jordan Kelley told us that “Bitcoin demand in Asia is amazing. We have many Asian countries seeking to enhance consumer capability to buy and sell Bitcoin securely and safely.” We’ve emailed Robocoin for comment about how the FSC’s ban will affect its plans in Asia.

Government attitudes toward Bitcoin differ widely throughout Asia, but the FSC’s decision is yet another sign that the cryptocurrency’s increasing mainstream acceptance also means it will come under scrutiny by more financial regulators.

The value of Bitcoins plunged in December after China’s biggest Bitcoin Exchange, BTCChina, stopped accepting deposits in Chinese yuan. The company said that the People’s Bank of China (PBoC) had spoken to several Chinese payment processors and asked them to cease trading with Bitcoin exchanges by January 1. The PBoC had enacted a partial ban on Dec. 5, stating that that “Bitcoins are virtual goods that have no legal status or monetary equivalent and should not be used as currency.”

Shortly afterward, Bitcoin exchanges in India were shut down after its banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), warned users against security and financial risks.

Other regulatory bodies in Asia, however, treat Bitcoins differently. In Hong Kong, for example, Bitcoins are not currently controlled by any government organizations or central bank. In fact, Horizon Ventures, the Hong Kong-based venture capital firm of Li Ka-shing, Asia’s richest man, recently made a vote of confidence in Bitcoin by investing in BitPay. The Singaporean government has also decided not to regulate Bitcoins.

In the U.S., several government agencies are competing to regulate Bitcoin, but it is currently being treated like money, which creates a barrier to entry for Bitcoin-based startups. In the UK, the Financial Services Authority does not consider Bitcoin to be ‘flat’ money or eMoney, and the European central bank’s view is that Bitcoin is not money and doesn’t require regulation yet.

As TechCrunch’s Mike Butcher noted during the Bitcoin London conference in July, the cryptocurrency is being treated in widely different ways by different countries: as money, as an asset class, as the first highly secure P2P global information exchange, as a technology platform and even as if it is a startup entity in its own right.

Financial regulations help legitimize Bitcoin, but at the same time, they also take away many of the things that were seen as advantages of the cryptocurrency, including peer-to-peer exchanges that were free from international sanctions, fees and taxes.

RISKY BUSINESS: The FSC and central bank say that the virtual currency is volatile and, as it is not issued by a monetary authority, it does not have legal protection

By Crystal Hsu / Staff reporter





The central bank and the Financial Supervisory Commission yesterday warned against bitcoin use in Taiwan, saying the virtual currency does not enjoy legal protections.

The regulators also said they may take necessary steps if financial institutions engage in bitcoin business, according to a joint statement issued yesterday.

The warning came after several monetary and financial regulators around the world have made similar moves in recent weeks to discourage bitcoin transactions, as the digital money gains in popularity and value.

“Bitcoin holders are on their own, as the currency is not issued by any monetary authority and is therefore not entitled to legal claims or guarantee of conversion,” the regulators said in the statement.

Bitcoin is not a real currency or a commonly accepted payment tool given its volatile values and its inability to be used for book-keeping or debit purposes, they said.

The official currency, the New Taiwan dollar, is guaranteed all legal protections, according to the statement.

Central bank Governor Perng Fai-nan (彭淮南) said last month he and his colleagues have kept a close watch on the development of bitcoin and compared its transactions to deals in precious metals.

The central bank and the commission have not issued warnings against investment in gold or other precious metals.

The two regulators painted bitcoin trading as highly speculative, and said holders should watch out for drastic volatility, malicious default, hacker attack, Internet theft and other risks.

Transactions in the virtual currency could also be connected to money laundering, smuggling, drug trafficking and other illegal activities, they said. However, SinoPac Financial Holding Co (永豐金控) earlier lent support to investment in bitcoins, saying it is to increase in value and popularity, in keeping with the fast-growing prevalence of e-commerce.

Transaction risks are minimal and bearable like all other investment instruments, SinoPac Financial chief economist Jack Huang (黃蔭基) said on Dec 4.

Meanwhile, a Taiwanese online shopping service operator plans to start accepting the virtual currency on its shopping site tomorrow and welcomes Beijing’s ban on Chinese financial institutions handling bitcoin transactions, because it could create new business opportunities.

Chinese people who possess bitcoins are expected to be more willing to use the digital money for online shopping because it’s harder for them to take advantage of appreciations in the currency’s value since the People’s Bank of China imposed the ban on Dec. 7, according to sources at Wayi International Digital Entertainment Co (華義國際).

However, given the volatility of bitcoin’s value, the company will limit its holdings of the new type of payment instrument to control risks.

Chinese people who possess bitcoins are expected to be more willing to use the digital money for online shopping because it’s harder for them to take advantage of appreciations in the currency’s value since the People’s Bank of China imposed the ban on Dec. 7, according to sources at Wayi International Digital Entertainment Co (華義國際).

However, given the volatility of bitcoin’s value, the company will limit its holdings of the new type of payment instrument to control risks.

The government will bar the use of cryptocurrencies as a means of payment for goods and services, saying the wider use of digital assets threatens the nation’s financial system and economy.

Business operators -- including crypto exchanges -- must not provide such payment services, and are barred from acting in a manner that promotes the use of digital assets to pay for goods or services, the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a statement on Wednesday. However, the new regulation won’t affect trading or investments in digital assets, the agency said.

While the restrictions on use of digital currencies for transactions will be effective starting on April 1, companies will have until the end of April to comply with the new rules, the regulator said. It said the curbs on cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin for commercial transactions are in line with regulations in Europe, the United Kingdom, South Korea and Malaysia.

Thailand’s crackdown on digital assets comes as individuals -- especially young investors -- boost their crypto trading in search of better returns amid the country’s economic slowdown. Commercial banks have been cautioned against direct involvement in trading of digital assets due to high volatility, uncertainty and risk.

The development of any unit of pricing other than the Thai baht will increase the cost of economic activities and reduce the efficiency of monetary policy transmission, the regulator said. In the event of a liquidity crisis, the Bank of Thailand will not be able to provide assistance to various financial institutions in forms other than the baht, it said.

Under the new rules, digital-asset service providers are required to halt advertising, soliciting or establishing a system to facilitate payment of goods and services via digital wallets. Business operators must warn clients against the use of digital assets for payments and may cancel their accounts if they are found breaching the rules, it said.

The value of digital assets held by Thais has soared to 114.5 billion baht from 9.6 billion baht a couple of years ago, the government said in January. The average daily turnover has jumped to 4.8 billion baht from 240 million baht, with the number of active trading accounts swelling to 1.98 million from 170,000 before the pandemic.","Govt bars use of cryptocurrencies as method of payment

214,Tonga,Legal, Tonga plans to make bitcoin legal tender by the end of 2023. This has been planned since late 2021.[197],197,cite_note-197,https://www.aljazeera.com/economy/2021/12/6/palau-pop-18000-seeks-to-blaze-trail-with-official-crypto,NA,197,"One of the world’s smallest nations hopes to launch the first government-backed national stablecoin in 2022.

Palau – population roughly 18,000 – is unlikely to be at the top of many people’s minds when they think of places at the cutting edge of technological innovation.

But the tiny Pacific island nation, located about 900km (559 miles) west of the Philippines, is on a bold mission to spearhead the official adoption and endorsement of cryptocurrencies.

Under a partnership with United States-based cryptocurrency company Ripple, Palau is exploring plans to launch the world’s first government-backed national stablecoin in the first half of 2022.

Pegged to a real-world currency

While running on the same digital ledger technology, or blockchain, as other cryptocurrencies, stablecoins differ from other digital currencies in having their value pegged to a real-world asset such as the US dollar. For stablecoin proponents, that gives the digital currencies an edge over notoriously volatile cryptos such as Bitcoin, whose price has swung between $5,000 and $65,000 in the last 20 months alone.

Palauan President Surangel Whipps, Jr has touted the adoption of a stablecoin as a way to make life more convenient for citizens and diversify the economy away from tourism, which before the pandemic accounted for about half of gross domestic product (GDP).

Palau’s GDP shrank by 8.7 percent last year, with a further contraction of 17.6 percent expected in 2021, according to a report by the Graduate School USA, largely due to the collapse of travel due to COVID-19.

The Asian Development Bank in April granted the country a $25m loan to keep it afloat.

Ripple, which is based in San Francisco, has pledged to work with Palau to explore “a USD-backed stablecoin”, strategies for cross-border payments and other features using its XRP Ledger such as a corporate registry.

In a media briefing last week, Whipps said he envisaged citizens purchasing goods in shops with their phones and government employees receiving their salaries instantaneously instead of waiting days for the transaction to go through at their bank.

“Why not make it that simple?” Whipps told local reporters.

“Having a digital currency in some ways kind of eliminates the need for a bank,” he said. “You know, it makes it so everybody’s their own bank.”

‘At the mercy of the inflation of the US dollar’

Under the plans, which remain in the early stages following the signing of a memorandum of understanding last month, Palau’s digital currency would be backed by the US dollar.

Palau, which is an independent country but relies on the US for aid and security under a Compact of Free Association, does not have its own currency or central bank and uses the US dollar as its official currency.

Still, there is considerable ambiguity about what will result from Palau’s partnership with Ripple – a reality acknowledged by the Palauan leader himself, who has described the “first step” as getting “as much information as we can” to “come up with a plan to harness and make use of this”.

Ongerung Kambes Kesolei, editor of the Tia Belau newspaper, told Al Jazeera that while the idea of emerging technologies might excite some people in the country, most had little idea how cryptocurrency worked.

“It is a highly volatile industry but whether it would work, the jury is still out there,” Kesolei said.

“There is a cryptocurrency market but still, many countries around the world are sceptical or in a wait-and-see attitude. No one country is fully diving in, which shows that this economic sector is still in its early stage of development so to say it would work can’t be said right now.”

Lord Fusitu’a, a vocal cryptocurrency advocate who sits in parliament in the Pacific Island nation of Tonga, told Al Jazeera there was a danger in putting the digital currency of a country in the hands of a private company.

“The world’s first stablecoin is not an honour, I would not brag about it because you’re effectively putting your country at the mercy of the inflation of the US dollar, but without getting any of its benefits,” Fusitu’a said.

“And you’re tying it to a digital currency that’s owned by a private company, that the people in Palau did not vote for. This is a private company, and private companies have only one function, and that is to make a profit for themselves.”

Fusitu’a also questioned the choice of Ripple, which the US Securities and Exchange Commission has taken to court for allegedly violating rules against the trading of unregistered securities. Ripple has denied the SEC’s allegations, arguing that its digital coins are not securities under the law.

“The reason it is considered a security is precisely because it’s not a decentralised, distributed cryptocurrency like Bitcoin,” Fusitu’a said.

‘The nature of money’

Countries have taken varied approaches to the emergence of cryptocurrencies, the total value of which last month exceeded $3 trillion, according to CoinGecko.

In September, El Salvador became the first country to start accepting Bitcoin as legal tender. Many other governments have eyed digital currencies with suspicion, with countries including China, India, Indonesia implementing or considering a ban.

Ross Buckley, an expert in FinTech and digital currencies at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia, told Al Jazeera that while officially-backed digital currencies had the potential to empower people in the Pacific who lacked access to banking services, there were many challenges to their implementation.

Buckley said countries such as China, the UK and Canada had yet to launch official digital currencies despite years of research and planning.

ANKARA, April 16 (Reuters) - Bitcoin tumbled more than 4% on Friday after Turkey’s central bank banned the use of cryptocurrencies and crypto assets for purchases citing possible “irreparable” damage and transaction risks.

In legislation published in the Official Gazette, the central bank said cryptocurrencies and other such digital assets based on distributed ledger technology could not be used, directly or indirectly, to pay for goods and services.

The decision could stall Turkey's crypto market, which has gained momentum in recent months as investors joined the global rally in bitcoin, seeking to hedge against lira depreciation and inflation that topped 16% last month.

Bitcoin was down 4.6% at $60,333 at 1117 GMT after the ban, which was criticised by Turkey's main opposition party. Smaller coins ethereum and XRP , which tend to move in tandem with bitcoin, fell between 6%-12%.

In a statement, the central bank said crypto assets were ""neither subject to any regulation and supervision mechanisms nor a central regulatory authority"", among other security risks.

""Payment service providers will not be able to develop business models in a way that crypto assets are used directly or indirectly in the provision of payment services and electronic money issuance"" and will not provide any services, it said.

""Their use in payments may cause non-recoverable losses for the parties to the transactions ... and include elements that may undermine the confidence in methods and instruments used currently in payments,"" the central bank added.

This week Royal Motors, which distributes Rolls-Royce and Lotus cars in Turkey, became the first business in the country to accept payments in cryptocurrencies.

Cryptocurrencies remain little-used for commerce even as they become increasingly mainstream global assets, although companies including Tesla Inc (TSLA.O) and travel site Expedia Group Inc (EXPE.O) do accept such payments.

Tough regulatory clampdowns on cryptocurrencies by major economies have been relatively rare, with most seeking to clarify rules rather than prevent usage. Traders say such bans are hard to enforce, and crypto markets have in the past shrugged off such moves.

Turkey's main opposition leader Kemal Kilicdaroglu described the decision as another case of ""midnight bullying"", referring to President Tayyip Erdogan's decision last month -- announced in a midnight decree -- to fire the central bank governor.

""It's like they have to commit foolishness at night,"" he said on Twitter.

The legislation goes into effect on April 30th.

HEAVY HAND

Crypto trading volumes in Turkey hit 218 billion lira ($27 billion) from early February to 24 March, up from just over 7 billion lira in the same period a year earlier, according to data from U.S. researcher Chainalysis analysed by Reuters.

Trading spiked in the days after Erdogan replaced the bank governor, sending the lira down as much as 15%.

Last week, Turkish authorities demanded user information from crypto trading platforms.

""Any authority which starts regulating (the market) with a ban will end up frustrated (since this) encourages fintech startups to move abroad,"" said economist Ugur Gurses.

In what would be one of the world’s strictest policies, India will propose a ban on cryptocurrencies and fines on those trading or holding the assets. China banned such trading in 2017, slamming the brakes on a free-wheeling emerging crypto industry.

""Headlines like this at this point tend to send a bolt across the bows,"" said Joseph Edwards, head of research at crypto brokerage Enigma Securities in London, while noting that similar regulatory moves in Nigeria and India ""didn't even move the needle"".

Ahmed Faruk Karsli, CEO of Turkish payment systems firm Papara, said the ban on transferring money to cryptocurrency platforms via fintech systems was unexpected.

""It is much easier to choose to ban than to make an effort to deal with this financial technology,"" he told Ekoturk TV.

""This is a regulation that makes me concerned for my country.""

Over the past two weeks, Macron has been actively involved in resolving Europe's escalating security crisis. First, he met with Russian President Vladimir Putin, recognizing Moscow's interests, and then with Ukrainian President Vladimir Zelensky, thanking him for his desire to implement the Minsk deal, Izvestia writes. However, the actual test of how effective this diplomatic marathon turns out will be on February 10, when the Normandy Four's political advisers convene in Berlin.

Macron informed Zelensky that Russia has no intention of escalating the conflict in Ukraine and that diplomacy is the only option to resolve the situation, emphasizing that there is no alternative to the Minsk agreements. Moscow has frequently urged Germany and France, the Normandy format's mediators, to persuade Ukraine to follow the Minsk deal. According to Izvestia, it is unclear whether Macron's visit to Kiev should be viewed as this sort of ""influence"". Benoit Simian, a member of the French National Assembly commission on defense, told the newspaper that Macron's visit to Russia is the start of a difficult diplomatic dance that will take place in the coming days. According to him, the current diplomatic crisis over submarines and the development of the AUKUS alliance have demonstrated that France's foreign policy methods must be transformed. The French leader definitely needs foreign policy victories now, since the nation’s presidential elections are on the horizon in April, the newspaper writes. According to Izvestia, the French political establishment generally welcomes the president's initiative and considers it logical. Vice President of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defense and Armed Forces in the French Senate Joël Guerriau told the newspaper that France’s EU presidency, its participation in the Normandy Four, and NATO membership are three reasons why Macron is diplomatically involved in resolving the Ukrainian crisis, while Ukraine's proximity to the EU and Russia indicates that both sides' positions are taken into account. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: US and Europe try to agree on new anti-Russian sanctions A delegation from the State Department and the US Treasury is leaving for Europe to discuss planned sanctions that are to be imposed against Russia. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, the West is torn between wanting to punish the Kremlin and wanting to negotiate. The visit comes amid reports of progress in European security discussions, with French President Emmanuel Macron claiming to be the peacemaker who can reach a deal with both Moscow and Kiev on Ukraine.

The mission is technical in nature, according to US Department of State spokesperson Ned Price, and its objective is to coordinate the sanctions strategy of the US and its allies. The fact that such a mission is being conducted is not surprising, but the US mission to Europe currently appears to be attempting to reconcile two decisions that are scheduled to be made soon, the newspaper writes. Influencing Russia will be a hot topic in Congress in the foreseeable future. The Senate is currently debating a new bill on sanctions. Senator Bob Menendez, one of the individuals behind it, said that the document is almost finished, but there is no clarity on two crucial aspects: Nord Stream 2 and the timing of sanctions. On the other hand, Menendez himself bluntly admitted that the Biden administration does not want anti-Russian sanctions to be introduced preemptively, the newspaper writes. The White House's determination to prevent early punishment of Russia could be strengthened after the recent news from Moscow. According to media reports, during his visit to Russia, French President Emmanuel Macron achieved an agreement with Russian President Vladimir Putin to de-escalate the situation in Ukraine. Kommersant: Russia and Belarus reveal the content of their allied military doctrine The new edition of the Military Doctrine of the Union State was approved by Presidents Vladimir Putin of Russia and Alexander Lukashenko of Belarus back in November, but the content of the document became public only recently. According to Kommersant, compared to the 2001 doctrine, the new document lists many more factors that negatively affect the security of the union of both countries. Nonetheless, contrary to NATO's fears, it does not explicitly say that Russian nuclear weapons can be stationed on Belarusian soil.

The 19-page document specifies that the military-political situation developing around the Union State is characterized by growing negative processes in global and regional security, caused both by the geopolitical rivalry between the leading world powers and by a clash of interests of individual states. Compared to the 2001 doctrine, the number of factors threatening the security of the Union State members has expanded considerably. According to Kommersant, several of these threats were referenced by Russian authorities as legitimate reasons for their demand that the US and NATO provide security assurances to Moscow. That said, the new pact states that Russia and Belarus are committed to resolving issues through political and non-military means. Military force is considered to be a last resort only when all other non-military options have been exhausted. The text stressed that Russian nuclear weapons will continue to play an important role in averting nuclear and conventional armed engagements. The United States and its NATO partners are deeply concerned about the likelihood of Russian nuclear weapons being stationed on Belarusian territory. However, the new Military Doctrine of the Union State does not explicitly state that Russian nuclear weapons can be deployed anywhere beyond the Russian Federation, according to Kommersant. Izvestia: Russia approves concept of cryptocurrency regulation Conducting all cryptocurrency transactions through Russian banks, licensing operators of such transactions, introducing limits for unqualified investors, identifying digital currency owners, and other measures to legalize crypto in Russia are contained in the concept of the Ministry of Finance, approved by the government on February 7. Now the Ministry, together with the Bank of Russia, must submit the bill to the government by February 18. Having approved the concept, the government officially sided with those who advocated regulating the cryptocurrency, and not banning it, experts told Izvestia.

According to expert data from the Ministry of Finance, the amount of money Russians (their number exceeds 12 mln) have in cryptocurrency wallets comes to about 2 trillion rubles ($26.72 bln), with Russia ranking third in the world in terms of mining digital assets. Deputy Head of the State Duma Working Group on Cryptocurrency Regulation Andrey Lugovoy told Izvestia that he supported the government's decision. ""In my opinion, this is a sensation. The approved concept proposed by the Ministry of Finance supports cryptocurrency. Individuals can own and dispose of it as they see fit. But at the same time, it will be legalized as much as possible, identified, and taxes should be paid from its turnover,"" he said. Credit institutions already have a developed system for identifying and monitoring financial transactions, and using it for cryptocurrency transactions is a logical move, head of Raiffeisenbank's client department Kirill Matveev told the newspaper. In his opinion, despite significant costs, the introduction of such a mechanism by the bank will take no more than a year. Nezavisimaya Gazeta: Tax on hydrocarbon emissions might be looming over Russia Russian President Vladimir Putin chaired a meeting of the Council for Science and Education on Science Day. According to the Kremlin press service earlier, the event was dedicated to implementing the most important innovative projects - in particular, monitoring climate change and developing low-carbon energy. According to Nezavisimaya Gazeta, Russia might need to move towards the ""green agenda"" more actively by introducing a tax on hydrocarbon emissions. Scientists believe that this will help the country move towards higher rates of development.

For the first time, crypto-commodities owners can now store their Bitcoin, Ethereum and other altcoins in a vault located in Almas Tower, Dubai – the headquarters of DMCC, the world’s most interconnected Free Zone, and the leading trade and enterprise hub for commodities.

The vault at DMCC is one of the most secure precious metal facilities in the world and will store all Regal Assets’ crypto investments in the physical form – without connection to a network – alongside the company’s’ current stock of physical gold. All the physical devices are fully insured for the crypto-commodities market value against theft, hacking or natural disaster.

“At the heart of DMCC’s long term strategic growth plan is the use of technology and innovation to disrupt and connect new markets, industries and customers. The announcement today embodies this approach and will no doubt come as good news to the international cryptocurrency market,” said Ahmed Bin Sulayem, Executive Chairman, DMCC.

“We have developed what we believe is the number one most secure way of investing in Bitcoin, Ethereum and other crypto-commodities”, said Tyler Gallagher, CEO of Regal Assets DMCC. “Investors worldwide are now seeing the potential in cryptos, but they are reluctant to store large amounts of coins in online wallets and exchanges due to the high risk of hacking, identity theft, malware and other issues that can literally obliterate an investment.”

The Regal Assets security process involves generating offline blocks, using the specific crypto-commodity’s blockchain derived algorithm. The key is then printed offline within the secured environment on a specialized wallet and placed in deep cold storage in the DMCC vault. Investors can purchase additional coins, or sell, at any time they wish.

DMCC was named ‘Global Free Zone of the Year’ 2017 by The Financial Times fDi Magazine, for the third year running and serves as a global marketplace for commodities to drive trade flows through Dubai. As a DMCC licensed company, Regal Assets DMCC operates in a secure regulated trading environment and offers a service to global investors to the highest standards of international compliance.

""DMCC is the only Free Zone in the Middle East to have a government-issued license to trade in crypto-commodities and offers unparalleled full market value insurance on such investments,” said Gerhard Schubert, Chairman of the Board for Regal Assets DMCC.

“We are delighted to make this bold step forward to engage with the crypto-commodity industry and offer all those operating within it a safe and secure environment for their investment,” he added.

UK's financial regulator orders shutdown of all Bitcoin ATMs All cryptocurrency ATMs in the UK are illegal, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned operators of cryptocurrency ATMs in the UK to shut down their machines or else face enforcement action. In its announcement, the financial watchdog said that it hasn't granted any of the crypto firms registered with it the permission to operate ATM services. That means all crypto ATMs in the UK are illegal.

""Crypto ATMs offering cryptoasset exchange services in the UK must be registered with us and comply with UK Money Laundering Regulations,"" the regulator wrote. As The Telegraph reports, there are around 81 functional crypto ATMs in Britain based on data from the Coin ATM Radar tracker, located mostly inside supermarkets and convenience stores.

These ATMs allow users to deposit cash in exchange for cryptocurrency, which they can then transfer to their digital wallets. The regulator previously raised concerns that the machines could be used for money laundering, because they require minimal background checks, especially for small deposits.

Gidiplus, a Bitcoin ATM operator, tried to overturn the FCA's refusal to grant it a license. The regulator argued that bad actors could take advantage of its machines' weak identity checks on people depositing less than £250. Money launderers and illegal businesses could potentially use multiple ""mules"" to do small transactions in order to avoid getting noticed by authorities. The UK's Upper Tribunal ruled against Gidiplus, which has since sold its ATMs to an Eastern European buyer.

The regulator ended its announcement with a warning that cryptocurrency is high-risk and that people could lost their money if something goes wrong:","All cryptocurrency ATMs in the UK are illegal, the Financial Conduct Authority said.

The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) has warned operators of cryptocurrency ATMs in the UK to shut down their machines or else face enforcement action. In its announcement, the financial watchdog said that it hasn't granted any of the crypto firms registered with it the permission to operate ATM services. That means all crypto ATMs in the UK are illegal.

""Crypto ATMs offering cryptoasset exchange services in the UK must be registered with us and comply with UK Money Laundering Regulations,"" the regulator wrote. As The Telegraph reports, there are around 81 functional crypto ATMs in Britain based on data from the Coin ATM Radar tracker, located mostly inside supermarkets and convenience stores.

WASHINGTON — The Internal Revenue Service today issued a notice providing answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) on virtual currency, such as bitcoin. These FAQs provide basic information on the U.S. federal tax implications of transactions in, or transactions that use, virtual currency.

In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency -- i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance — but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction.

The notice provides that virtual currency is treated as property for U.S. federal tax purposes. General tax principles that apply to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency. Among other things, this means that:

Wages paid to employees using virtual currency are taxable to the employee, must be reported by an employer on a Form W-2, and are subject to federal income tax withholding and payroll taxes.

Payments using virtual currency made to independent contractors and other service providers are taxable and self-employment tax rules generally apply. Normally, payers must issue Form 1099.

The character of gain or loss from the sale or exchange of virtual currency depends on whether the virtual currency is a capital asset in the hands of the taxpayer.

A payment made using virtual currency is subject to information reporting to the same extent as any other payment made in property.

Further details, including a set of 16 questions and answers, are in Notice 2014-21PDF, posted today on IRS.gov.

We appreciate the Committee’s interest in this important issue, and your continued support of our efforts to prevent illicit financial activity from exploiting potential gaps in our regulatory structure as technological advances create new and innovative ways to move money.

FinCEN’s mission is to safeguard the financial system from illicit use, combat money laundering and promote national security through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of financial intelligence and strategic use of financial authorities. FinCEN works to achieve its mission through a broad range of interrelated strategies, including:

Administering the Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) - the United States’ primary anti-money laundering (AML)/counter-terrorist financing (CFT) regulatory regime;

Sharing the rich financial intelligence we collect, as well as our analysis and expertise, with law enforcement, intelligence, and regulatory partners; and,

Building global cooperation and technical expertise among financial intelligence units throughout the world.

To accomplish these activities, FinCEN employs a team comprised of approximately 340 dedicated employees with a broad range of expertise in illicit finance, financial intelligence, the financial industry, the AML/CFT regulatory regime, technology, and enforcement. We also leverage our close relationships with regulatory, law enforcement, international, and industry partners to increase our collective insight and better protect the U.S. financial system.

What is Virtual Currency?

Before moving into a discussion of FinCEN’s role in ensuring we have smart regulation for virtual currency that is not too burdensome but also protects the U.S. financial system from illicit use, let me set the stage with some of the definitions we are using at FinCEN to understand virtual currency and the various types present in the market today. Virtual currency is a medium of exchange that operates like a currency in some environments but does not have all the attributes of real currency. In particular, virtual currency does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction. A convertible virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts as a substitute for real currency. In other words, it is a virtual currency that can be exchanged for real currency. At FinCEN, we have focused on two types of convertible virtual currencies: centralized and decentralized.

Centralized virtual currencies have a centralized repository and a single administrator. Liberty Reserve, which FinCEN identified earlier this year as being of primary money laundering concern pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, is an example of a centralized virtual currency. Decentralized virtual currencies, on the other hand, and as the name suggests, have no central repository and no single administrator. Instead, value is electronically transmitted between parties without an intermediary. Bitcoin is an example of a decentralized virtual currency. Bitcoin is also known as cryptocurrency, meaning that it relies on cryptographic software protocols to generate the currency and validate transactions.

There are a variety of methods an individual user might employ to obtain, spend, and then “cash out” either a centralized or decentralized virtual currency. The following illustration shows a typical series of transactions in a centralized virtual currency, such as Liberty Reserve:

By way of comparison, the next illustration shows a very similar series of transactions in a decentralized virtual currency such as Bitcoin:

From a “follow the money” standpoint, the main difference between these two series of transactions is the absence of an “administrator” serving as intermediary in the case of Bitcoin. This difference does have significance in FinCEN’s regulatory approach to virtual currency, and that approach will be addressed further during the course of my testimony today.

Money Laundering Vulnerabilities in Virtual Currencies

Any financial institution, payment system, or medium of exchange has the potential to be exploited for money laundering or terrorist financing. Virtual currency is not different in this regard. As with all parts of the financial system, though, FinCEN seeks to understand the specific attributes that make virtual currency vulnerable to illicit use, so that we can both employ a smart regulatory approach and encourage industry to develop mitigating features in its products.

Some of the following reasons an illicit actor might decide to use a virtual currency to store and transfer value are the same reasons that legitimate users have, while other reasons are more nefarious. Specifically, an illicit actor may choose to use virtually currency because it:

Enables the user to remain relatively anonymous;

Is relatively simple for the user to navigate;

May have low fees;

Is accessible across the globe with a simple Internet connection;

Can be used both to store value and make international transfers of value;

Does not typically have transaction limits;

Is generally secure;

Features irrevocable transactions;

Depending on the system, may have been created with the intent (and added features) to facilitate money laundering;

If it is decentralized, has no administrator to maintain information on users and report suspicious activity to governmental authorities;

Can exploit weaknesses in the anti-money laundering/counter terrorist financing (AML/CFT) regimes of various jurisdictions, including international disparities in, and a general lack of, regulations needed to effectively support the prevention and detection of money laundering and terrorist financing.

Because any financial institution, payment system, or medium of exchange has the potential to be exploited for money laundering, fighting such illicit use requires consistent regulation across the financial system. Virtual currency is not different from other financial products and services in this regard. What is important is that financial institutions that deal in virtual currency put effective AML/CFT controls in place to harden themselves from becoming the targets of illicit actors that would exploit any identified vulnerabilities.

Indeed, the idea that illicit actors might exploit the vulnerabilities of virtual currency to launder money is not merely theoretical. We have seen both centralized and decentralized virtual currencies exploited by illicit actors. Liberty Reserve used its centralized virtual currency as part of an alleged $6 billion money laundering operation purportedly used by criminal organizations engaged in credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking, and child pornography. One Liberty Reserve co-founder has already pleaded guilty to money laundering in the scheme. And just recently, the Department of Justice has alleged that customers of Silk Road, the largest narcotic and contraband marketplace on the Internet to date, were required to pay in bitcoins to enable both the operator of Silk Road and its sellers to evade detection and launder hundreds of millions of dollars. With money laundering activity already valued in the billions of dollars, virtual currency is certainly worthy of FinCEN’s attention.

That being said, it is also important to put virtual currency in perspective as a payment system. The U.S. government indictment and proposed special measures against Liberty Reserve allege it was involved in laundering more than $6 billion. Administrators of other major centralized virtual currencies report processing similar transaction volumes to what Liberty Reserve did. In the case of Bitcoin, it has been publicly reported that its users processed transactions worth approximately $8 billion over the twelve-month period preceding October 2013; however, this measure may be artificially high due to the extensive use of automated layering in many Bitcoin transactions. By way of comparison, according to information reported publicly, in 2012 Bank of America processed $244.4 trillion in wire transfers, PayPal processed approximately $145 billion in online payments, Western Union made remittances totaling approximately $81 billion, the Automated Clearing House (ACH) Network processed more than 21 billion transactions with a total dollar value of $36.9 trillion, and Fedwire, which handles large-scale wholesale transfers, processed 132 million transactions for a total of $599 trillion. This relative volume of transactions becomes important when you consider that, according to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the best estimate for the amount of all global criminal proceeds available for laundering through the financial system in 2009 was $1.6 trillion. While of growing concern, to date, virtual currencies have yet to overtake more traditional methods to move funds internationally, whether for legitimate or criminal purposes.

Mitigating Money Laundering Vulnerabilities in Virtual Currencies

FinCEN’s main goal in administering the BSA is to ensure the integrity and transparency of the U.S. financial system so that money laundering and terrorist financing can be prevented and, where it does occur, be detected for follow on action. One of our biggest challenges is striking the right balance between the costs and benefits of regulation. One strategy we use to address this challenge is to promote consistency, where possible, in our regulatory framework across different parts of the financial services industry. It ensures a level playing field for industry and minimizes gaps in our AML/CFT coverage.

Recognizing the emergence of new payment methods and the potential for abuse by illicit actors, FinCEN began working with our law enforcement and regulatory partners several years ago to study the issue. We understood that AML protections must keep pace with the emergence of new payment systems, such as virtual currency and prepaid cards, lest those innovations become a favored tool of illicit actors. In July 2011, after a public comment period designed to receive feedback from industry, FinCEN released two rules that update several definitions and provide the needed flexibility to accommodate innovation in the payment systems space under our preexisting regulatory framework. Those rules are: (1) Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Money Services Businesses; and (2) Definitions and Other Regulations Relating to Prepaid Access.

The updated definitions reflect FinCEN’s earlier guidance and rulings, as well as current business operations in the industry. As such, they have been able to accommodate the development of new payment systems, including virtual currency. Specifically, the new rule on money services businesses added the phrase “other value that substitutes for currency” to the definition of “money transmission services.” And since a convertible virtual currency either has an equivalent value in real currency, or acts a substitute for real currency, it qualifies as “other value that substitutes for currency” under the definition of “money transmission services.” A person that provides money transmission services is a “money transmitter,” a type of money services business already covered by the AML/CFT protections in the BSA.

As a follow-up to the regulations and in an effort to provide additional clarity on the compliance expectations for those actors involved in virtual currency transactions subject to FinCEN oversight, on March 18, 2013, FinCEN supplemented its money services business regulations with interpretive guidance designed to clarify the applicability of the regulations implementing the BSA to persons creating, obtaining, distributing, exchanging, accepting, or transmitting virtual currencies. In the simplest of terms, FinCEN’s guidance explains that administrators or exchangers of virtual currencies must register with FinCEN, and institute certain recordkeeping, reporting and AML program control measures, unless an exception to these requirements applies. The guidance also explains that those who use virtual currencies exclusively for common personal transactions like buying goods or services online are users, not subject to regulatory requirements under the BSA. In all cases, FinCEN employs an activity-based test to determine when someone dealing with virtual currency qualifies as a money transmitter. The guidance clarifies definitions and expectations to ensure that businesses engaged in such activities are aware of their regulatory responsibilities, including registering appropriately. Furthermore, FinCEN closely coordinates with its state regulatory counterparts to encourage appropriate application of FinCEN guidance as part of the states’ separate AML compliance oversight of financial institutions.

It is in the best interest of virtual currency providers to comply with these regulations for a number of reasons. First is the idea of corporate responsibility. Legitimate financial institutions, including virtual currency providers, do not go into business with the aim of laundering money on behalf of criminals. Virtual currencies are a financial service, and virtual currency administrators and exchangers are financial institutions. As I stated earlier, any financial institution could be exploited for money laundering purposes. What is important is for institutions to put controls in place to deal with those money laundering threats, and to meet their AML reporting obligations.

At the same time, being a good corporate citizen and complying with regulatory responsibilities is good for a company’s bottom line. Every financial institution needs to be concerned about its reputation and show that it is operating with transparency and integrity within the bounds of the law. Legitimate customers will be drawn to a virtual currency or administrator or exchanger where they know their money is safe and where they know the company has a reputation for integrity. And banks will want to provide services to administrators or exchangers that show not only great innovation, but also great integrity and transparency.

The decision to bring virtual currency within the scope of our regulatory framework should be viewed by those who respect and obey the basic rule of law as a positive development for this sector. It recognizes the innovation virtual currencies provide, and the benefits they might offer society. Several new payment methods in the financial sector have proven their capacity to empower customers, encourage the development of innovative financial products, and expand access to financial services. We want these advances to continue. However, those institutions that choose to act outside of their AML obligations and outside of the law have and will continue to be held accountable. FinCEN will do everything in its regulatory power to stop such abuses of the U.S. financial system.

As previously mentioned, earlier this year, FinCEN identified Liberty Reserve as a financial institution of primary money laundering concern under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act. Liberty Reserve operated as an online, virtual currency, money transfer system conceived and operated specifically to allow – and encourage – illicit use because of the anonymity it offered. It was deliberately designed to avoid regulatory scrutiny and tailored its services to illicit actors looking to launder their ill-gotten gains. According to the allegations contained in a related criminal action brought by the U.S. Department of Justice, those illicit actors included criminal organizations engaged in credit card fraud, identity theft, investment fraud, computer hacking, narcotics trafficking, and child pornography, just to name a few. The 311 action taken by FinCEN was designed to restrict the ability of Liberty Reserve to access the U.S. financial system, publicly notify the international financial community of the risks posed by Liberty Reserve, and to send a resounding message to other offshore money launderers that such abuse of the U.S. financial system will not be tolerated and their activity can be reached through our targeted financial measures.

Sharing Our Knowledge and Expertise on Virtual Currency

As the financial intelligence unit for the United States, FinCEN must stay current on how money is being laundered in the United States, including through new and emerging payment systems, so that we can share this expertise with our many law enforcement, regulatory, industry, and foreign financial intelligence unit partners, and effectively serve as the cornerstone of this country’s AML/CFT regime. FinCEN has certainly sought to meet this responsibility with regard to virtual currency and its exploitation by illicit actors. In doing so, we have drawn and continue to draw from the knowledge we have gained through our regulatory efforts, use of targeted financial measures, analysis of the financial intelligence we collect, independent study of virtual currency, outreach to industry, and collaboration with our many partners in law enforcement.

In the same month we issued our guidance on virtual currency, March 2013, FinCEN also issued a Networking Bulletin on crypto-currencies to provide a more granular explanation of this highly complex industry to law enforcement and assist it in following the money as it funnels between virtual currency channels and the U.S. financial system. Among other things, the bulletin addresses the role of traditional banks, money transmitters, and exchangers that come into play as intermediaries by enabling users to fund the purchase of virtual currencies and exchange virtual currencies for other types of currency. It also highlights known records processes associated with virtual currencies and the potential value these records may offer to investigative officials. The bulletin has been in high demand since its publication and the feedback regarding its tremendous value has come from the entire spectrum of our law enforcement partners. In fact, demand for more detailed information on crypto-currencies has been so high that we have also shared it with several of our regulatory and foreign financial intelligence unit partners.

One feature of a FinCEN Networking Bulletin is that it asks the readers to provide ongoing feedback on what they are learning through their investigations so that we can create a forum to quickly learn of new developments, something particularly important with a new payment method. Based on what we are learning through this forum and other means, FinCEN has issued several analytical products of a tactical nature to inform law enforcement operations.

Equally important to our ongoing efforts to deliver expertise to our law enforcement partners is FinCEN’s engagement with our regulatory counterparts to ensure they are kept apprised of the latest trends in virtual currencies and the potential vulnerabilities they pose to traditional financial institutions under their supervision. FinCEN uses its collaboration with the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council (FFIEC) BSA Working Group as a platform to review and discuss FinCEN’s regulations and guidance, and the most recent and relevant trends in virtual currencies. One such example occurred just recently, when several FinCEN virtual currency experts gave a comprehensive presentation on the topic to an audience of Federal and state bank examiners at an FFIEC Payment Systems Risk Conference. The presentation covered an overview of virtual currency operations, FinCEN’s guidance on the application of FinCEN regulations to virtual currency, enforcement actions, and ongoing industry outreach efforts.

FinCEN also participates in the FBI-led Virtual Currency Emerging Threats Working Group, the FDIC-led Cyber Fraud Working Group, the Terrorist Financing & Financial Crimes-led Treasury Cyber Working Group, and with a community of other financial intelligence units. We host speakers, discuss current trends, and provide information on FinCEN resources and authorities as we work with our partners in an effort to foster an open line of communication across the government regarding bad actors involved in virtual currency and cyber-related crime.

Finally, FinCEN has shared its strategic analysis on money laundering through virtual currency with executives at many of our partner law enforcement and regulatory agencies, and foreign financial intelligence units, as well as with U.S. government policy makers.

Outreach to the Virtual Currency Industry

RecognizingRecognizing that the new, expanded definition of money transmission would bring new financial entities under the purview of FinCEN’s regulatory framework, shortly after the publication of the interpretive guidance and as part of FinCEN’s ongoing commitment to engage in dialogue with the financial industry and continually learn more about the industries that we regulate, FinCEN announced its interest in holding outreach meetings with representatives from the virtual currency industry. The meetings are designed to hear feedback on the implications of recent regulatory responsibilities imposed on this industry, and to receive industry’s input on where additional guidance would be helpful to facilitate compliance.

We held the first such meeting with representatives of the Bitcoin Foundation on August 26, 2013 at FinCEN’s Washington, DC offices and included attendees from a cross-section of the law enforcement and regulatory communities. This outreach was part of FinCEN’s overall efforts to increase knowledge and understanding of the regulated industry and how its members are impacted by regulations, and thereby help FinCEN most efficiently and effectively work with regulated entities to further the common goals of the detection and deterrence of financial crime. To further capitalize on this important dialogue and exchange of ideas, FinCEN has invited the Bitcoin Foundation to provide a similar presentation at the next plenary of the Bank Secrecy Act Advisory Group (BSAAG) scheduled for mid-December. The BSAAG is a Congressionally-chartered forum that brings together representatives from the financial industry, law enforcement, and the regulatory community to advise FinCEN on the functioning of our AML/CFT regime.

Conclusion

The Administration has made appropriate oversight of the virtual currency industry a priority, and as a result, FinCEN’s efforts in this regard have increased significantly over recent years through targeted regulatory measures, outreach to regulatory and law enforcement counterparts and our partners in the private sector, and the development of expertise. We are very encouraged by the progress we have made thus far. We are dedicated to continuing to build on these accomplishments by remaining focused on future trends in the virtual currency industry and how they may inform potential changes to our regulatory framework for the future.

Good afternoon.

I am delighted to be here today. Thank you for having me.

I am excited to dive into the fireside chat. But before I do, I would like to anchor the conversation with some brief benchmarks in FinCEN’s approach to virtual currency and emerging technology.

I think it is important, particularly for me in my role as a regulator, that when I take the time to give a speech, or appear on a panel or give a presentation, I have something meaningful or important to say, and that I am clear about what it is that I am saying.

Purpose, clarity, and transparency are important, particularly in what we do.

1) So first, I want to discuss how FinCEN is approaching virtual currency and financial innovation;

2) Second, I want to discuss the value of Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) filings we receive from financial institutions, including exchangers in virtual currencies. This information is critical to our mission of keeping our country strong, our financial system secure, and our families and communities safe from harm.

Virtual Currencies and Innovation

Let me begin with our approach to virtual currency.

Innovation in financial services can be a great thing—providing customers greater access to an array of financial services and at faster speeds than ever before. However, as industry evolves and adopts these new technologies, we also must be cognizant that financial crime evolves right along with it, or indeed sometimes because of it, creating opportunities for criminals and bad actors, including terrorists and rogue states.

Virtual currency is an example of both aspects. Major money services businesses are looking at how to incorporate blockchain payments to expedite remittances to locations around the world. But like any payment system or medium of exchange, virtual currency has the potential to be exploited for money laundering and other illicit finance.

Nobody here today wants to see innovative products and services misused to support terrorism, facilitate child exploitation, or become another vehicle for criminals to carry out fraud, identity theft, corruption, or extortion. There are already too many victims out there who may never be made whole again, and harm can be done with devastatingly increasing speed, breadth, and obscurity in the digital world.

The BSA and its regulations are designed to guard against these threats, but these laws and regulations can only do so much on their own. Compliance with our anti-money laundering (AML) and countering the financing of terrorism (CFT) framework is critical to protecting our financial system and safeguarding the incredible innovations within the FinTech space.

Our role at FinCEN is to protect and secure our financial system from those who seek to misuse important technological advancements for nefarious purposes—harming victims while undermining trust in our financial system upon which innovation and our country prosper.

Regulation of Virtual Currency

FinCEN’s leadership in AML/CFT regulation and supervision in the area of virtual currency goes back years, focusing on exchangers, administrators, and other persons involved in money transmission denominated in convertible virtual currency.

In 2011, FinCEN issued a final rule amending definitions and other regulations relating to money services businesses to provide that money transmission covers the acceptance and transmission of value that substitutes for currency.[1] Virtual currency is such a substitute and is covered by that regulation. To further clarify this point, in 2013, FinCEN issued guidance on the application of FinCEN’s regulations to persons administering, exchanging, or using virtual currencies. [2]

Since then, FinCEN has issued several administrative rulings clarifying how this impacts different business models in the virtual currency space.

January 2014 Administrative Ruling on the Definition of User in Context of Mining[3]; January 2014 Administrative Ruling on the Definition of User in Context of Software Development and Investing in Virtual Currencies[4]; April 2014 Administrative Ruling on Rental of Computer System for Mining Virtual Currency[5]; October 2014 Administrative Ruling on Virtual Currency Trading Platform[6]; October 2014 Administrative Ruling on Virtual Currency Payment System[7]; and August 2015 Administrative Ruling on Persons Issuing Physical or Digital Negotiable Certificates of Ownership of Precious Metals.[8]

In addition, we are working closely with our federal regulatory colleagues, including the SEC and CFTC, for coordinated policy development and regulatory approaches, including addressing risks.

These risks include potential illicit finance and fraud surrounding Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs). As my SEC and CFTC colleagues have pointed out, this rapidly growing area has gained a lot of recent public attention. While ICO arrangements vary and, depending on their structure, may be subject to different authorities, one fact remains absolute: FinCEN, and our partners at the SEC and CFTC, expect businesses involved in ICOs to meet all of their AML/CFT obligations. We remain committed to taking appropriate action when these obligations are not prioritized, and the U.S. financial system is put at risk.

I wanted to take a moment today just to make a few additional clarifications based on questions we have received.

First, as our March 2013 guidance indicates, FinCEN’s rules apply to all transactions involving money transmission—including the acceptance and transmission of value that substitutes for currency, which includes virtual currency. Thus, our regulations cover both transactions where the parties are exchanging fiat and convertible virtual currency, but also to transactions from one virtual currency to another virtual currency.

Further, businesses providing anonymizing services (commonly called “mixers” or “tumblers”), which seek to conceal the source of the transmission of virtual currency, are money transmitters when they accept and transmit convertible virtual currency, and, therefore, have regulatory obligations under the BSA.

In short, individuals and entities engaged in the business of accepting and transmitting physical currency or convertible virtual currency from one person to another or to another location are money transmitters subject to the AML/CFT requirements of the BSA and its implementing regulations.

To comply with these obligations, virtual currency money transmitters are required to (1) register with FinCEN as a money services business, (2) develop, implement, and maintain an AML program designed “to prevent the [MSB] from being used to facilitate money laundering and terrorist finance,” and (3) establish recordkeeping, and reporting measures, including filing Suspicious Activity Reports (SARs) and Currency Transaction Reports (CTRs).

It is important to understand that these requirements apply equally to domestic and foreign-located convertible virtual currency money transmitters, even if the foreign located entity has no physical presence in the United States, as long as it does business in whole or substantial part within the United States.

Similarly, we would expect financial institutions adopting new FinTech to assess and understand whether the new financial products and services may be vulnerable to exploitation for financial crime; and whether this financial service activity has AML/CFT obligations under FinCEN’s regulations. We can help answer the question, but avoiding the question for fear of the answer is not a legitimate strategy; indeed it is unwise.

Examination and Supervision Efforts

Examination and supervision are critical components of our efforts to proactively mitigate potential illicit finance risks associated with virtual currency.

Working closely with our delegated BSA examiners at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), FinCEN has worked to ensure that virtual currency money services businesses understand and comply with their regulatory obligations through effective supervisory examinations. FinCEN and the IRS have examined over 30 percent of all registered virtual currency exchangers and administrators since 2014. Our goal is to ensure that all virtual currency money transmitters undergo regular, routine compliance examinations—just like every other U.S. financial institution—to help illuminate weaknesses and strengthen protocols before a lapse occurs.

Our efforts here have had a tangible, positive impact on compliance programs, and we have seen SAR filings from virtual exchanges rise tremendously over the past few years.

Also important is that our examinations have included a wide array of virtual currency businesses: virtual currency trading platforms, administrators, virtual currency kiosk (or ATM) companies, crypto-precious metals dealers, and individual peer-to-peer exchangers. We have focused on both registered and unregistered exchanges.

This variety is important because, whether a business is operating as an individual peer-to-peer exchanger of one virtual currency, or a large, multi-national trading platform offering numerous virtual currencies, we expect you to comply with your AML/CFT regulatory obligations.

And there is no question we have noticed some compliance shortcomings.

All financial institutions should be implementing a strong AML program long before they first receive notice that an examination is forthcoming. We have been surprised to see financial institutions establish an adequate number of compliance staff and take appropriate steps to meet their regulatory requirements only after they receive notice.

Let this message go out clearly today: This does not constitute compliance.

Compliance does not begin because you may get caught, or because you are about to be discovered. That is not a culture that protects our national security, our country, and our families. It is not a culture we will tolerate.

A strong culture of compliance should be part of building your operations from the ground up, and you can expect that we will identify where this is not taking place and take appropriate action.

There is too much at stake in this space, for our nation, for our financial system, for our communities, and for our families. We will hold companies and individuals accountable when they disregard their obligations and allow the financial system to be exploited by criminal actors, whether in wire transfers or cryptocurrencies.

My hope is that professionals like yourselves take the time to read about the details of actions taken by FinCEN—even if they aren’t assessments against banks—to learn ways to improve your own compliance regime.

BTC-e

An example of FinCEN’s commitment to pursuing those whose failures to have even basic controls have enabled criminals to launder proceeds is the $110 million penalty we issued against BTC-e—our first action against a foreign-located MSB and our most recent civil action involving virtual currency. BTC-e was an Internet-based virtual currency exchanger that offered exchange in fiat currency, as well as convertible virtual currencies like Bitcoin, Dash, and Ether. At one point BTC-e served approximately 700,000 customers across the world and was associated with bitcoin wallets that had received over 9.4 million bitcoins.

The company lacked even basic controls to prevent the use of its services for illicit purposes. As a result, they attracted and maintained a customer base that included many criminals who desired to conceal proceeds from crimes such as ransomware, fraud, identity theft, public corruption, and drug trafficking. Included in FinCEN’s findings, we discussed BTC-e’s failure to establish policies and procedures to handle transactions going through anonymizing services like bitcoin mixers, and offering the anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrency Dash. Importantly, FinCEN’s BSA enforcement investigation also led to the assessment of a $12 million civil money penalty against one of BTC-e’s administrators, Alexander Vinnik—the largest individual liability penalty FinCEN has assessed to date.

While FinCEN led the civil investigation on this entity, we also partnered with our law enforcement and Department of Justice colleagues who indicted and shuttered the exchange. We will aggressively pursue individuals and companies, in any venue necessary, who do not take their obligations under U.S. law seriously.

FinCEN prioritizes ensuring that all exchangers and administrators comply with the BSA and its implementing regulations regardless of their size. While the implementation of AML/CFT requirements may vary depending on whether or not the business is a peer-to-peer exchange or a large high-volume exchanger, it is important that all financial institutions are playing their part to protect the financial system and the people using it.

Egmont

We also are sharing experience on cryptocurrency with foreign partners through the Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units (FIU) and other international forums. I will be leading a special forum of FIU heads. One of the priority areas we will focus on involves virtual currencies. We selected this issue as a priority area for discussion, due to the impact that enhanced FIU analysis and customer products can have on the effectiveness of an FIU and its ability to combat money laundering and terrorist financing. Our work in this forum will help FIUs gain a better understanding of virtual currency risks and typologies and effective approaches to the analysis and use of relevant financial information. It will also aim to help FIUs better advise reporting entities on what to report about potential virtual currency transactions, or activity and other relevant information for revealing the flows, actors, and methods involved in financing illicit activities.

SAR Filings

Let me assure you, our success in protecting financial institutions and innovative virtual currency payment and FinTech systems from being exploited for money laundering and other illicit financing purposes depends very much on effective implementation by you, the private sector.

One great success we have seen recently is the substantial increase in virtual currency SAR filings over the past few years.

We now receive over 1,500 SARs per month describing suspicious activity involving virtual currency, with reports coming from both MSBs in the virtual currency industry itself and other financial institutions. We see the industry developing new techniques for identifying suspicious activity in virtual currency, showing us what is possible and giving us unique insight into certain financial crimes. By helping us identify and investigate this illicit activity, the industry can focus on legitimate applications and innovations, and stamp out negative perceptions of virtual currency as the coinage of the dark web and bad actors.

I know you frequently hear FinCEN and our law enforcement partners laud the importance and value of SARs, but I want to emphasize the differences these filings can make. Recall the BTC-e case example I discussed earlier. SAR filings played a critical role in the investigation of that case. It was filings by both banks and other virtual currency exchanges that provided critical leads for law enforcement. This information included beneficial ownership information, additional activity attributed to the exchange of which we were previously unaware, jurisdictional information, and additional financial institutions we could contact for new leads. All of this was obtained through SARs and the supporting documents filed by financial institutions.

Other individual filings continue to help us work to combat threats here in this country, including the opioid crisis that has been plaguing communities across the nation. On April 3, Attorney General Jeff Sessions recognized FinCEN’s participation in Operation Disarray, part of the Joint Counter Opioid Darknet Enforcement (J-CODE) effort—a nation-wide effort to target darknet drug traffickers across the country. In this and other operations with law enforcement, BSA data has been instrumental. We have worked with law enforcement to investigate leads provided in SARs on opioid vendors to combat the illicit use of virtual currency—leading to arrests of dealers and distributors, identification of overseas suppliers, and disruption of the marketplaces that have facilitated the distribution of these destructive, addictive opioids.

Additional Efforts

We also are actively working to develop information sharing programs to help the financial services sector defend itself from these threats—programs like FinCEN Exchange and other cyber defense programs offered by the Treasury. We are in the process of setting up a virtual currency-focused FinCEN Exchange program with the private sector and law enforcement, which will provide a platform for all of us to engage with industry developments, concerns, and share risks and threats that we are seeing.

Lastly, we are continuously developing our technological capabilities and expertise to remain in step with the evolution of industry as well as the threats that persistently seek to take advantage of new vulnerabilities. We will be just as persistent. We are working hard on the dynamic infrastructure across analytic, operational, policy, and legal areas to be as agile and forward-looking as the world in which we operate and the financial system that is our mission to protect and advance. To that, I have brought into my Front Office a Chief of Strategic Advancement & Tactical Development, Michael Mosier, to spearhead this forward-looking, cross-functional approach.

All of these efforts—including the use of advisories to increase effective SAR reporting, and the establishment of FinCEN Exchange as an information sharing mechanism—help financial institutions protect themselves, their customers, and our financial system.

Conclusion

As I conclude, I want to make clear:

1) We are focused on swiftly and continuously building our capabilities and understanding in the emerging technologies space to (a) rapidly identify risks, (b) close gaps, and (c) support responsible innovation through clarity;

2) SAR reporting is of critical importance to our work in the virtual currency space to help identify emerging threats and typologies, (a) for the sake of the victims that are targeted, (b) for financial institutions to better understand and effectively report on these threats, and (c) for public trust and reliance in the good work being done in the financial innovation space;

3) We will continue to update our guidance relating to emerging technology, such as virtual currency, in close dialogue with industry, so that we are improving our understanding of both the risks and the clarity that is needed to support responsible innovation; and

4) FinCEN will aggressively pursue individuals and companies who do not take their obligations under U.S. law seriously, whether by targeting victims or enabling those who do.

I very much appreciate the opportunity to engage in a substantive discussion with Clay and the other industry experts here, so that we can work together to advance innovation while protecting the integrity of the financial system upon which the success of your businesses and our country depend. It is important that we keep this dialogue going.

Thank you for having me here today.

U.S. District Judge Alison Nathan in Manhattan rejected a bid by Anthony Murgio to dismiss two charges related to his alleged operation of Coin.mx, which prosecutors have called an unlicensed bitcoin exchange.

Murgio had argued that bitcoin did not qualify as “funds” under the federal law prohibiting the operation of unlicensed money transmitting businesses.

But the judge, like her colleague Jed Rakoff in an unrelated 2014 case, said the virtual currency met that definition.

“Bitcoins are funds within the plain meaning of that term,” Nathan wrote. “Bitcoins can be accepted as a payment for goods and services or bought directly from an exchange with a bank account. They therefore function as pecuniary resources and are used as a medium of exchange and a means of payment.”

The decision did not address six other criminal counts that Murgio faces, Nathan wrote.

Brian Klein, a lawyer for Murgio, said he disagreed with the decision.

“Anthony Murgio maintains his innocence and looks forward to clearing his name at his upcoming trial,” he added.

Prosecutors last year charged Murgio over the operation of Coin.mx, and in April charged his father Michael with participating in bribery aimed at supporting it.

Authorities have said Coin.mx was owned by Gery Shalon, an Israeli man who, along with two others, was charged with running a sprawling computer hacking and fraud scheme targeting a dozen companies, including JPMorgan, and exposing personal data of more than 100 million people.

That alleged scheme generated hundreds of millions of dollars of profit through pumping up stock prices, online casinos, money laundering and other illegal activity, prosecutors have said.

Shalon has pleaded not guilty, and is being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He hired new lawyers last month and is seeking permission to replace lawyers who joined the case in June, a Monday court filing showed.

Tuvalu's government aims to become the world's first paperless society, using blockchain technology to create a national digital ledger.

This would mean all of Tuvalu's data - be it legislative, executive, judicial or financial - would be stored online using Bitcoin Satoshi Vision's (BSV) public ledger.

It also wants to turn its cash economy into one using some form of digital currency.

In a nutshell, a blockchain is a digital ledger of transactions shared by a network of computers.

Any input or change to the blockchain was traceable to its source and recorded by all computers on the network.

In theory this made it near impossible to hack or cheat and rendered any data stored on it immutable.

Tuvalu's Minister for Justice, Communications and Foreign Affairs, Simon Kofe, said this made the technology perfect for something like a national registry.

""The vision is really to explore what is out there that could really give Tuvalu an advantage or at least close the gap with other countries,"" Kofe said.

There are less than 13,000 people living on Tuvalu's nine atoll islands.

The country had only one bank and no credit card facilities.

Kofe said Tuvalu's small size, its isolation and vulnerability to climate change presented huge developmental challenges.

But he believed technology could level the playing field.

""The benefits that people will see is that they will have greater access, work will be more efficient…there's a lot of things that we can do, and it is going to impact the people in a very positive way,"" he said.

Auckland lawyer Campbell Pentney - an expert on blockchain and cryptocurrency - said Tuvalu's proposed digital transformation jumped a whole heap of technological solutions.

""We already store documents online using databases and typical computers. So there is an argument as to why would you need the blockchain to actually store these?"" Pentney said.

On the other hand, Pentney said he understood why Tuvalu was interested in the technology.

""Effectively the blockchain records cannot be deleted. So that is the argument for having information on a blockchain where there is no location of it. It is sort of in the cloud or on the blockchain and it is there for eternity,"" Pentney said.

Community consultations on the ambitious project were well underway and were scheduled to conclude in April.

Then the Tuvalu government and its partners nChain, Faiā and Elas would define its scope and cost and look to start implementation.

nChain Director of Commercial and Strategy, Simit Naik, said learning about the needs of the Tuvaluan community was an important first step.

""We have been doing interviews with citizens from across all the different islands, taking and understanding the drivers - what people find difficult,"" Naik said.

He said one of the biggest issues raised by Tuvaluans was the difficulty of accessing cash across Tuvalu's nine island groups.

Naik said whatever the end-product, it was important it improved the lives of Tuvaluans.

""We are, alongside our partners Faiā and Elas, all focussed on ensuring that we deliver solutions that not just meets the demands of the government but also meets the demands of individuals, citizens.""

At this stage Tuvalu was not leaning towards Bitcoin or any of the other readily available cryptocurrency options.

It seemed more interested in creating a digital currency of its own to enable citizens to access government services and for trading within the Tuvaluan economy.

Kofe said for Tuvalu the digital transformation project was not just about modernising - it was about survival.

""You know Tuvalu is facing this climate change and sea-level rise…The mobility of this, putting all of our data on a blockchain secures it and we can basically operate from anywhere and that is essentially the idea behind it,"" said Kofe.

But there was still a lot of controversy surrounding blockchain and cryptocurrency.

Those opposed to the technology alleged its circumvention of traditional banking systems made it easy game for criminal and terrorist organisations.

And even more neutral parties had security concerns and questioned whether it could be properly regulated.

However, Pentney said the traceability of data on a block chain made it difficult to hide criminal activity.

""It would probably be quite dangerous or foolhardy to use Bitcoin to be able to transact in criminal activities,"" Pentney said.

""There are other coins called privacy coins and they are designed to mask the transaction history and they are even more controversial and encountering all sorts of regulatory headwinds.

""So as long as you are outside the privacy coin network, I think that the claims that Bitcoin is used predominantly for criminal purposes is very much overblown,"" he said.

As to Tuvalu's proposed digital transformation, Pentney said someone must be first. Simon Kofe said who better than Tuvalu?

""Because Tuvalu is small and we are able to implement new technologies quite quickly on a national level and that could be a prototype a pattern for other countries to also follow suit,"" said Kofe.

But was this all feasible? On the technical side, Naik said while the scale of the project was large, they were not actually creating any new technology but rather making the most of existing blockchain infrastructure.

The most interesting challenge he anticipated was linking Tuvalu's visionary new digital economy to the rest of the world's.

On the financial side, Kofe said Tuvalu was funding this ""discovery phase"" itself but he said it would consider other options once the cost of the project was fully determined.

One possibility that had been proposed was leveraging funding through the renewal of the rights to Tuvalu's lucrative internet domain name "".tv"" which was extremely popular among internet streaming sites like Twitch.

The rights for its distribution, currently held by American company Verisign, expired this year.

But that was a whole new story in itself.

""Technology is simply a tool. It is a tool that can be used for the good and it can also be used in a negative way to impact people,"" Kofe said.

""But we are hoping that what we are doing here is positive, it is something that is going to improve life for the ordinary Tuvaluan.""",Translation Unavailable,6,"[('cryptocurrency', 0.031768546), ('virtual', 0.029607689), ('use', 0.02090096), ('state', 0.020772124), ('payment', 0.020059291), ('legal', 0.019635182), ('ban', 0.017162815), ('government', 0.016882187), ('bitcoins', 0.015462362), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.015034701)]",8,"[('crypto', 0.070355825), ('report', 0.047153495), ('asset', 0.037488226), ('unavailable', 0.035197947), ('law', 0.032530762), ('translation', 0.029793777), ('cryptocurrencies', 0.024107039), ('currency', 0.019878889), ('legal', 0.019419), ('business', 0.017929077)]"

This time, it is about a change of plans in the distorted monetary cone that the government have been trying to implement since 2017, adding a crypto-factor to the current equation.

During a live TV transmission on Wednesday, Maduro announced a series of economic measures, including the new monetary system that goes by the name “Bolívar Soberano” or Sovereign Bolivar, which will be launched on August 20, along with the reduction of five zeroes and, interestingly, it will be anchored to the polemic official cryptocurrency: the Petro.

“The economic reconversion will start on August 20 definitively with the circulation and issuance of the new Sovereign Bolivar, the new monetary cone that is going to have a new method of anchoring the petro, and with the reduction of 5 zeroes and with an exchange rate tethered to petro,” Maduro explained.

The new monetary cone comes with the elimination of the aforementioned five zeroes, currently present in the “Bolivar Fuerte” or Strong Bolivar – which is worth remembering, it took away three zeroes from the cone in force until January 1, 2008, and it was implemented by late Head of State, Hugo Chavez – and the substitution of actual exchange parity that will stop using US Dollar value in favor of that established for the Petro, which at the same time, is backed by the price of Venezuelan oil barrel.

Details surrounding the tethering of the national currency to the Petrocoin are yet to be unveiled; however, the mandatary stated the novelty as a response to the effects of the so-called “economic war”, although it admitted during the announcement that his government has failed to implement politics effective enough to restart production in the Caribbean country.

Blurred future for the Petro

The Petro was launched on February this year, yet it cannot be traded in any of the major virtual cryptocurrency exchanges around the world, nor is it known with certainty what the raised funds are for. Due to this, and other reasons, it is considered by several analysts and blockchain experts as a scam to facilitate money laundering.

In addition, the virtual token can be purchased only with foreign currency, which is considered as a big contradiction of the local government, given the strict exchange control imposed in the country for more than a decade with a very limited access to said currencies via the use of regular methods, prompting citizens and local investors to refer to the black market so to acquire them at ridiculous higher rates.

As the Petro has not dragged enough interest from Venezuelans, some experts predicted that it will fail to succeed and end up abandoned by its own creators, thus enlarging the list of failed projects of the local government.

About the rest of cryptocurrencies

Due to the inflationary crisis of the Bolívar, the interest of the Venezuelan people for the cryptocurrencies has been increasing while the government put obstacles to its development in the country with sounded cases of arrests and seizures of mining material. It was not until the arrival of Petro that the government had to soften its position with respect to the rest of the cryptocurrencies even leading to its “legalization” last January.

In this regard, Carlos Vargas, superintendent of the cryptocurrency of the Venezuelan government said:

Ngày 30.10, chúng tôi liên hệ Công ty thương mại và tư vấn Đại Dương Xanh thì được nhân viên hướng dẫn nhiệt tình việc mua vé máy bay trực tuyến thanh toán bằng bitcoin (BTC) và cho hay việc thanh toán này vẫn diễn ra bình thường, không gián đoạn thời điểm nào.

Chọn vé máy bay từ TP.HCM đi Hà Nội với giá hơn 3,2 triệu đồng và chọn thanh toán bằng BTC, sau khi cập nhật một số thông tin theo yêu cầu, số tiền hơn 3,2 triệu đồng mà chúng tôi phải trả được quy đổi tương đương 22,89329 mBTC (mBTC là đơn vị nhỏ của BTC, 1 mBTC = 0,001 BTC). Ngoài nhận đặt vé máy bay trong nước thanh toán bằng BTC, công ty này còn nhận đặt vé đi Thái Lan, Singapore, Hồng Kông, Pháp...

Một số quán ăn, nhà hàng còn chấp nhận thanh toán bằng BTC. Quán ăn sushi ở Q.Bình Thạnh (TP.HCM) nhận tiền thanh toán bằng BTC từ tháng 4 và duy trì đến nay.

Trước quán bán bánh pizza trên đường Lý Tự Trọng, Q.1, TP.HCM, có bảng chỉ dẫn nhận diện máy rút tiền từ BTC với tên gọi BTM. Máy BTM được đặt gần cuối quán và giá quy đổi từ BTC sang tiền Việt liên tục được cập nhật. Trong hơn 1 giờ chúng tôi quan sát, không thấy ai đến rút tiền tại máy. Cô nhân viên quán cho biết: Thời gian đầu đặt máy BTC, thỉnh thoảng có vài người nước ngoài đến rút tiền, sau này có cả người Việt. Máy không phải của quán đặt và quán cũng không nhận thanh toán bằng BTC mà do một đơn vị khác đặt ""nên chắc cũng không bị ảnh hưởng bởi việc cấm của nhà nước”, cô này nói.

Sau thông cáo của Ngân hàng Nhà nước (NHNN) về cấm sử dụng BTC làm phương tiện thanh toán và dẫn những quy định xử phạt hành chính cũng như sẽ xử phạt hình sự kể từ ngày 1.1.2018, các sàn giao dịch BTC như VBTC, Remitano... vẫn hoạt động bình thường, cũng không có hiện tượng bán tháo BTC.

Ông Trịnh Minh Phúc, thành viên sáng lập Bitcoin VN, đại diện cho Công ty TNHH Bitcoin VN, khẳng định công ty cũng như nhà đầu tư BTC hoàn toàn không bị ảnh hưởng bởi những thông tin trong bản thông cáo trên của NHNN. Toàn bộ hệ thống Bitcoin VN, sàn giao dịch VBTC (sàn mua bán BTC), 3 máy bitcoin ATM tại TP.HCM và Hà Nội sẽ hoạt động bình thường qua ngày 1.1.2018, ông Phúc nói.

Ông Phúc phân tích, NHNN trích dẫn khoản 1 điều 206 luật Hình sự đối với việc phát hành, cung ứng, sử dụng phương tiện thanh toán không hợp pháp sẽ bị phạt tiền hoặc đi tù. Quy định này đề cập chủ thể chỉ bị truy cứu nếu gây ra hậu quả thiệt hại tài sản từ 100 triệu đồng trở lên. Nếu không chứng minh được việc gây thiệt hại tài sản thì không thể bị truy cứu.

Bên cạnh đó, khi chưa có quy định rõ BTC là tiền, hàng hóa, tài sản, hay là một phương tiện thanh toán, thì đối tượng áp dụng của Nghị định 101/2012 không bao gồm các tổ chức như Bitcoin VN hay các khách hàng.

""Ông A bán 10 kg gạo cho bà B để đổi lấy 10 con gà. Phương tiện thanh toán ở đây hoàn toàn nằm ngoài thẩm quyền của NHNN vì gạo và gà không phải là một phương tiện thanh toán theo pháp luật VN"", ông Phúc dẫn chứng và cho rằng, nếu Chính phủ cho phép giao dịch BTC trên các sàn tập trung, việc thu thuế BTC như một dạng hàng hóa hoặc tài sản đặc biệt hoàn toàn khả thi với mức thuế hợp lý. Nếu cấm BTC hoặc thu thuế giao dịch BTC quá cao, Chính phủ sẽ hoàn toàn mất kiểm soát thị trường BTC vì lợi ích của việc trốn thuế giao dịch BTC cao hơn rủi ro bị phát hiện giao dịch ngầm. Ông Phạm Tiến Dũng, Vụ trưởng Vụ Ông Phạm Tiến Dũng, Vụ trưởng Vụ Thanh toán (NHNN), khẳng định hành vi phát hành, cung ứng, sử dụng BTC và các loại tiền ảo khác bị cấm tại VN. Điều này đã được quy định tại Nghị định 80/2016 và Nghị định 101/2012 của Chính phủ. Trường hợp vi phạm sẽ bị xử lý phạt hành chính từ 150 - 200 triệu đồng và xử lý trách nhiệm hình sự từ ngày 1.1.2018. Thế nhưng khi đề cập đến những giao dịch mua bán cũng như động thái xử lý, ông Dũng cho rằng NHNN chỉ quản lý về phương diện thanh toán. Theo Quyết định 1255/QĐ-TTg ngày 21.8.2017 của Thủ tướng Chính phủ, Bộ Tư pháp sẽ chủ trì xây dựng khung pháp lý quản lý, xử lý đối với tiền ảo, tài sản ảo với tư cách là tài sản trong thời gian tới.","Buy air tickets, food ... with Bitcoin
